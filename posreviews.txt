bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high s satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high a classic line inspector i m here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isn t 
homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they ll be next to end up on the streets but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it s like to be homeless that is goddard bolt s lesson mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet s on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can t step off the sidewalk he s given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it s written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they re survivors bolt isn t he s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it s fight or flight kill or be killed while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn t necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don t know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money or maybe this film will inspire you to help others 
brilliant over acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i m a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often 
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead 
this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well 
this isn t the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over dramatization mixed with robin s new love of the thriller but this isn t a thriller per se this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until william s character gets close to achieving his goal i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story all in all it s worth a watch though it s definitely not friday saturday night fare it rates a from the fiend 
yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don t even notice it happening fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn t rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good very nice time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story 
in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette when troubling questions arise about this boy s story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret according to film s official synopsis you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now the how did he lose his leg ending with ms collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land it s overkill the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr williams returns to new york possibly her blindness could be in question but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re editing how about a director s cut williams and bobby cannavale as jess don t seem initially believable as a couple a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage otherwise the cast is exemplary williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfect best of all collette s donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame ms oh is correct in saying collette might be you know like that guy from psycho there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere the night listener patrick stettner robin williams toni collette sandra oh rory culkin
the night listener robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand out low key performance what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories he s penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one s editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete s backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn t anticipate written by armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film s novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fan s hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand out low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for 
you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period this is a very chilling story even though it doesn t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and it s this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of it s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it s scary too this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end 
when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life jess and the world around him donna as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward it s to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didn t work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the s leading man looks and screen presence it s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now s 
i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well done some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too i d give the film an out of 
there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing it s authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boy s harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of william s more serious performances 
i enjoyed the night listener very much it s one of the better movies of the summer robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable it s a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience s imagination but this is a minor quibble 
the night listener is probably not one of william s best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe won t like the slow pacing of this movie but i think it s the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell it s a damn good and very original movie 
like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery such a waste because collette s performance was eerie and williams was believable i just kept waiting for it to get better i don t think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film it came across as a canadian movie something like the first few seasons of x files not cheap just hokey also it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy this movie needs to have a director s cut that tries to fix these problems 
the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin s adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 
popular radio storyteller gabriel no one robin williams scraggy and speaking in hushed hypnotic tones becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen year old boy from wisconsin named pete logand rory culkin who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents to boot pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still since his partner jess bobby cannavale good happens to be a survivor of hiv himself he also acquaints himself with pete s guardian a woman named donna toni collette brilliant and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin he discovers some secrets he was naturally not prepared to find based on real events that happened to armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with terry anderson and directed by patrick stetner this film moves a lot faster min maybe a few minutes longer than one might think a movie of this genre would run that s good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear it s bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn t sew up any of the plot openings or back story i d rather not go into any great detail except to say that if you are not familiar with mr maupin s works or his personal story you feel a little bit out of the loop here still the performances by williams i would ve loved to heard more of his narration personally collette cannavale culkin and much of the supporting cast the waitress at the restaurant collete s donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has are top notch and the mood established here namely the chilly lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york give a terrific framing for this story it may have ends that don t tie together particularly well but it s still a compelling enough story to stick with 
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams mild mannered portrayal doesn t do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort 
i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could ve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years 
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods along no so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionally good movie williams isn t terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collette s performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldn t win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days 
when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky and i ll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong while every movie has its flaws the night listener had an exceptionally low count if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done unfortunately if you read more than lines into that same review you discovered the poster s reason for disdain he she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack apparently so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director let s go over a quick checklist first great plot absolutely i won t give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such the story really will amaze you even more so because it s true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type cast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of well i ll let you see for yourself excellent direction certainly now unlike the other poster to which i referred i actually know something about direction i ve been sutdying the art of direction at school now for years of course i really don t think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that i m basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lol patrick stettner s direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast paced camera work and quick cuts we re so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera while other s feel as if they have to make the story with the camera i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all see lighting cinematography and editing great all around i ve already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so i ll just wrap it up in short go see this movie don t listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if they re so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive of the way through their post enjoy the show ben
somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u s treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief hacker doug hutchinson who stole forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn t top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellent foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost 
the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting no count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life sized toy people who populate the place onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character the clunky plodding non direction trite by the numbers script ugly washed out cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon overwrought string score morbid gloom doom atmosphere largely lousy acting karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm a real campy hoot 
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won t go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room dan basinger 
aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the s also he declared that he had murdered another people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical it s not morbid at all such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster my rate 
after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga recommended 
there s so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin en la mente del asesino inside the killer s mind that it s very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning let s just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done it s made with super black and white shots milimeters color interviews flashbacks aro tolbukhin it s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of the movie for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro s childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring i don t mean and don t want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy 
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones out of 
without kirsten miller this project needn t have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagner s dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didn t detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost 
sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love story and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d n ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does half good movie and won t do a film for less than million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslet s performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love stories as it is filmmakers shouldn t try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible i give this film a mere 
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i don t think anyone could have a better job than kate if it is a rainy day and you can t decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you won t regret it 
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the st century with great acting directing effects music and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn t like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i ve ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron s masterpiece titanic 
just two comments seven years apart hardly evidence of the film s relentless pulling power as has been mentioned the low budget telemovie status of gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se true the plot at its most basic is a re working of the amityville horror only without much horror more a case of intrigue gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments having picked the dvd up for a mere last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure would be an acceptable price for the film just don t expect fireworks 
what s inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason it s a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i ve rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it s a movie yes capital m there it s an epic it s a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times but the reason titanic works is that it s such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn t exactly dumb but it s not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn t cry when bambi s mom died i don t react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and i m sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you ll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of out of no not even the phantom menace and this movie made billion dollars worldwide it can t be bad not possible p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn t anything all that special no one will remember it in years but i m pretty sure titanic will be remembered 
previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and i m a guy in his s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a rating by imdb com users well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while of all votes gave it a rating gave it a rating these of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in ratings with a high rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me i ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn t like the movie that much and gave it a or a etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these will prove my point heaven s gate was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were ratings and ratings overall rating of big top pee wee got ratings and ratings overall rating of cat people got ratings and ratings overall rating of blind date got ratings and ratings overall rating of jumpin jack flash got ratings and ratings overall rating of what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their ratings are lower than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got ratings compare that to the other movies i just mentioned can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor 
i loved this movie since i was and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all it s a movie to watch with your family by far my mpaa rating pg for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nudity sexuality and some language 
the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes i m not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great i guess it s not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you haven t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time don t listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark don t be surprised if you cry too 
i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i don t think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene he s in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an bethany cox 
i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms titanic it was big fast and unsinkable until april it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet they re not annoying too much but watch this and you ll find out why they could become annoying http tinyurl com ojhoyn the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get oh yes we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garber idk he was so nice lovejoy david warner murdoch ewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smith bernard hill molly brown kathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an awesome
titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it s few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch 
the ship may have sunk but the movie didn t director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which rose s family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the one i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but it s good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good risk the movie is long but it s fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it 
titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies it has its problems what movies don t but still it s enjoyable when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you don t i know so many people who don t like this movie and i m not saying i don t see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isn t it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesn t actually exist but this is a movie doesn t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think it s unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected and finally if one is going to complain that they don t like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then i m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things it s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best i ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each other s names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall it s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it i give this movie not because i like romance movies but simply because it s an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events 
titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn t have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe it s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone s imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i ll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it s very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie 
another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesn t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended 
for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose s and jack s story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horner s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart won t go on from this one 
back in do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i don t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans of them being teenage girls i was years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didn t watch the film since i was a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardo s real nose ok i know that s silly to say but i did re watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in the upper class year old rose boards the ship with her fianc cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of rose s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first class formal dinner of the rapport building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third class but after cal s servant informs him of rose s whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the ship they then witness the ship s fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ship s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers rose s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack s pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship s first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down so does titanic live up to it s hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didn t get a lot of hype just because of leo s baby face or kate s amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie it s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day 
james cameron s titanic is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event it s an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope love and humanity leonardo dicaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma conveying passion trust insouciance and ingenuity he s a free spirited wanderer with artistic pretensions and a zest for life kate winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused upper class teen engaged to a nasty rich guy who finds herself one night plunged to the depths of despair billy zane is an arrogant racist abusive and ultra rich who would lie cheat steal bribe with money or even use an innocent young child to escape defeat he keeps a carat blue diamond worn by louis xvi kathy bates is the legendary unsinkable molly brown the richest woman in denver who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship frances fisheris is the impecunious cold snobbish mother who deathly afraid of losing her social stature forces her daughter to become engaged to marry a rich supercilious snob victor garber is the master shipbuilder the real life character who attempts to fix time to measure it in a sense to make it into history jonathan hyde is the white star chairman who wants the titanic to break the trans atlantic speed record in spite of warnings that icebergs may have floated into the hazardous northern crossing bill paxton is the opportunistic undersea explorer in search for a very rare diamond called the heart of the ocean gloria stuart is the year old woman who reveals a never before told love story the nightmare the horror and the shock are imprinted upon her deeply lined face titanic is loaded with luminous photography and sweeping visuals as the footage of the shipwrecked ocean liner lying motionless on the ocean floor the incredible transformation of the bow of the sunken titanic that takes the viewer back to revealing the meticulously re created interiors the first sight of the titanic steamed steadily toward her date with destiny the titanic leaving the southampton dock and some dolphins appear jumping racing along in front of the luxurious ship decaprio and winslet flying at the ship s front rail in a gorgeous magic moment the intertwining of past and present as jack was drawing rose on his paper the camera zooms closely on young rose s eye only to transform its shape into gloria stuart s aged eye chilling scenes titanic s inevitable collision with destiny james cameron in one of the most terrifying sequences ever put on film takes us down with the titanic finally leaving us floundering in the icy water screaming for help that never comes winner of academy awards including best picture james cameron s titanic is a gigantic epic where you don t just watch the film you experience it the visual effects are amazing like no other film s the decor is overwhelming james horner s music intensifies the emotions the whole movie is hunting and involving filled with a wide range of deep feelings it s truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship 
this movie re wrote film history in every way no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again i ve seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages 
titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic s legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april at an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic s many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and rose s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanic s officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire s captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer s former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husband s side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to `new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people s lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you 
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasn t that bad or else people wouldn t even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isn t for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hyped well we only have the movie going public to thank for that lol you see it s not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe let s face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april even the silverware for goodness sakes matched give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie not once not twice but maybe times and more so i really wouldn t say that this movie was overhyped at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didn t even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that million budget and much more personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone don t say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing i ve ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but let s face it the real star of the movie wasn t leo or kate it was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job it s not thier best work i ve seen much better work from both of them but it wasn t the worst i ve seen on screen before give them a break 
i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over hyped over blown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the academy awards even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe she ll want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought i ll give it a look see i didn t want to like it and i didn t i loved it what a great movie where to start first the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you don t just watch it you really do feel it then the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent winslet s being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as rose s mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then the details i m no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion s performance of my heart goes on problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just don t accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he s been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive 
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the that who wants to hear it if you missed the point of this beyond beautiful movie that s your loss the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted i know that it is the cynical s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock i am done 
every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies i ll mention titanic and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and they re too embarrassed now to admit it i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people won t even admit they enjoyed it folks let s get something straight you don t look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynic no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixed this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears the music which has also been a victim of the film s success was a key ingredient james horner s score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dion s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many i confess i am a titanic buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i ve had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanity another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed 
i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every character s heartaches and pains this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again i m sorry for those that don t understand the value of love family and friendship it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldn t be watched by children under because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life 
after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixer upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clich d story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there s not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that it s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later especially if you ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isn t an abundance of death and destruction in the film there s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the point the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that it s in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peter s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship although gantry row never quite transcends its made for television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isn t worth spending for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but it s worth a rental and it s definitely worth watching for free 
daniell steel s daddy what a refreshing story this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children how rare is that in these times of heather has two mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone with the father s roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga how disappointing to have it end every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role i would have loved to see each character develop over the years i loved this movie it is one i will defiantly watch every time it s on good story good acting and i hope this isn t a spoiler but no obtrusive sex or bad language yes it touched my heart warning get the kleenex ready what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it television or movie s daniell if your listening you go girl give us more 
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kids grow up one all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families 
it s heart warming to see a movie that doesn t bash males in this one the wife mother leaves her family to get in touch with herself or pursue her libido the father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them 
i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black white i knew my erotic hopes were dashed boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black white the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars essy persson and anna gael are intense and memorable ok so they re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls it s do you really expect teenagers from the s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won t be all you expect i don t think you ll be too too disappointed 
this is a film not porn this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss highly recommended for all film lovers 
it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today s standards the film is interesting and provocative therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl s school therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly the director radley metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography artistically however this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas therese and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism 
we watched this in my women s health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite 
i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell but she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has days to live lol whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie definitely a gem and totally original scott
i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his her reluctant guardian i ve seen enough of them baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small town china in the s extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom he s nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though she s showed great promise as street performing heir even after he reluctantly takes her back he s not too upset when she s kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young street smart girl had to go to survive in that society the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child it s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense the peek at small town life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film 
this movie is the best film ever i can t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye i admire this movie it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues music acting story plot a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson they were not conventional in real every scene they were together was priceless the camera work is flawless and grips you the acting is inspired xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well if you have t this movie try it once do watch it 
verhoeven s movie was utter and complete garbage he s a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch heinlein would have never supported that trash if he d been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some t a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn t get bored this anime isn t perfect but it s at least mostly accurate as best i can tell 
wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person liang is worried that a precious art shouldn t die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang s mind the film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth i can t recommend this film enough the whole film is in loops everything has a significance its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just minutes a total satisfaction for five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face last scene on the rope is phenomenal story and script is flawless actors are brilliant both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed very impressive it was not even nominated for oscars that year english patient got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category kolya won kolya was just ok and about english patient the lesser said the better watch it 
one of the most heart warming foreign films i ve ever seen the young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her doggie the old man the king of masks and liang the living boddhisatva spoiler the deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing loved the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story this is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version 
wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei i hope he has more stories in him the acting is sublime renying zhou as doggie was amazing very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight very believable as the jaded old traditionalist the soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem 
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the s chinese mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true to form both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that i ve seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression 
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wang s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art together wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which can t help but to move and inspire 
this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub titling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time period it is set there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past years but then we briefly see a motor car late s early s style and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war and the communist revolution which makes the central character s desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship maybe i m reading too much into this film but i don t think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality material but don t get me started on that 
king of masks bian lian in china is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film winner of awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian a street performer in s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it he has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can t afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society wang bianlian s story goes on from there the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well addressed there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well respected he regards himself as something low a half woman as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and xu zhu the actor who plays wang bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance 
this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended 
this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film 
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performance a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies 
robert a heinlein s classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoeven s film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoeven s film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinlein s death and believe it or not despite its differences this part animated series is plot wise the most faithful adaptation of heinlein s classic the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoeven s film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the book s plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but it s only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but it s far superior to the film heinlein s political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs aliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look 
as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i ve a feeling i ll be watching this again and again for years to come it s got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale 
when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china s devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the s he takes his new year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man there are many stories inside this one many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended stars 
an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film shameful since it warrants having a wider audience a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for film makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film 
one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories farewell my concubine the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney films in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work master wang is sold a son by a slave trader all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art but the son eventually is found out to be a girl from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera a regional operatic style related to peking opera fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang s portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality 
quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv april this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shame what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http www dvdbeaver com film dvdcompare kingofmasks htm wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw 
 masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it 
beautiful and touching movie rich colors great settings good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too 
this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it s over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time 
it s a tale that could have taken place anywhere really given the right circumstances street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to from there we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river traveling town to town he performs and has some degree of notoriety despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good overall the performances are first rate especially xu zhu who portrays the street performer the child renying zhou is beautiful and downright strong and withstands the overt prejudices well the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master liang an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love some have mentioned this film s remote similarities to ba wang bie ji farewell my concubine yet this film can t stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best my only qualm with the king of masks is the ending it was weak cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer the audience was already wrapped up in the story what was the needless manipulation for what a shame to bring a fine motion picture that far only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that it frankly made this film good instead of the classic it should ve been that aside the king of masks is still very well worth your time i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films highly recommended 
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed 
ok let s get this clear i m really not into sci fi but for some reason i love stargate sg jack o neil takes his team sg through a stargate a round device that creates a wormhole it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual sci fi series but it s not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci fi series i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets they have some of course but thanks to o neil who likes to keep a simple terminology there s not many the series has a nice blending of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects you re not going to find it here they don t use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects 
in the rapid economic development of s in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie 
this is a beautiful rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society s traditional notions the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old man s emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small 
the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that it s a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles 
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists and rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case the old man bianlian wang xu zhu is kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin the little girl doggie zhou renying is a cutie the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final minutes overall it s involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just don t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it 
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it 
i just saw this movie today with my children son and daughter at the rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian ming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self explanatory i won t give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than of the hollywood crap especially children s films out there cheers p s there is a real original king of masks who can could do masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to masks at a time then they would cut and change to new masks 
this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows it s full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning 
fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest the sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this vintage a cozy movie with splendid panoramas even when chopped down to pan and scan 
elephant walk starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk well eventually they do after the typhoid or cholera outbreak of course and much mayhem ensues taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler adventure flick when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day one of my favorite guilty pleasures in color too 
 or type on a computer keyboard they d probably give this eponymous film a rating of after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms no matter how menacing without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you ll detect the elephant people are faring less well today 
i got in to this excellent program in about season and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of and it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after seasons sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it 
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue but was pleased to find a fast paced script an underlying moral excellent portrayals from all the actors especially peter finch amazing special effects suspense and beautiful cinematography there s even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work all the supporting players round it out and i do wonder who trained all those elephants speaking of the stone buddha sequence you really can discern that it s vivien leigh in the long shots her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor s the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk if you want a thought provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring spend a few hours with elephant walk 
i watched elephant walk for the first time in about years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior rebecca as others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger than life yet deeply flawed relative you have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead meanwhile elephant walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to the letter the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation maltin gives elephant walk just two stars and imdb readers aren t much kinder but i enjoyed it despite its predictability elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father dana andrews a favorite in laura and the best year of our lives is wasted as elizabeth s frustrated admirer the real star is the bungalow one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history 
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon current day sri lanka upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd william dieterle who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i ve seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery 
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon although based upon the book by robert standish this initial set up is highly reminiscent of hitchock s rebecca with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased but dominant father taylor a last minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh looks creamy smooth in her high fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong however once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic this feeling hampers the ending as well still the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama a bit of travelogue interpretive dance an elephant stampede and a perfectly timed outbreak of cholera from 
elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi melodramatic mode it is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny a previous reviewer john mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called elephant walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late tom wiley right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water the river to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man that his son played by peter finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father s rowdy boys club as his role models the point of the father was that he was a self made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love ceylon today s sri lanka is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of miss taylor were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the british raj it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors j mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought for those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of miss taylor as she marries a man she doesn t really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased as i said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive in not on the home tv so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera work and scope 
my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twenty two when she made elephant walk remember i m nine so the feelings aren t sexual i just couldn t see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age she s almost seventy four but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss taylor s beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a well made point on human arrogance in the face of nature all in all a well spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video 
robert standish s novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle s film the story is about a rich powerful planter peter finch who brings a charming and tender beauty elizabeth taylor into the jungle as his bride the plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life for this reason taylor elegant as never in dazzling costumes finds herself in a strange atmosphere the echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals in her confusion boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman dana andrews who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love with echoes of jane eyre the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife elephant walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent the movie gave liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self respect than most of her other willful debutante rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for 
one of the first ova s original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles a cyberpunk sci fi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of near future pollution in a dystopian society the heroes of dominion are the tank police formed with a if we can t beat crime we ll get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch most if not all of these cops are borderline psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist buaku and his hench wo men the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time the animation is not state of the art but it s very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion the english dubbing is again lots of fun the soundtrack of the english version is also very good i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that anyway dominion tank police is great it s japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy filled with completely over the top characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously highly recommended 
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation while the first part acts and mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part acts and i do have some complaints though in the first part the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool buaku rules 
the anime that got me hooked on anime set in the year hey that s not too far away now the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence seeing as how crimes are happening ever seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem cops with tanks oh the insanity the heroes of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki a red haired japanese woman yeah i know they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy al leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain also known as brenten a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper britain didn t like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special a giant green monster tank doesn t exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it there s also specs the bifocal genius bible quoting god fearing chaplain purple mo hawked mohican and the pot bellied chief who s right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they re not very well liked by the people the villains are a cyborg named buaku who s got a mysterious past that s connected with a project known as green peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna uni puma in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven t been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the nd they re hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku the story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic manga book that s very hard to find all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you d better go get quentin tarantino uneven in places but still a lot of fun followed by new dominion tank police 
fact stargate sg is a cheesy sci fi tv series there s no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg remains a cheesy sci fi tv series stargate sg does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx aren t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn t going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either but and this is where i really think stargate sg deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that s actually worse than a one hour tv episode in fact some episodes actually could probably have been minutes long and still have been better than most movies and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg special i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg as yet another tacky sci fi show don t stick with it and you ll see what i m talking about 
scott bartlett s offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante garde cinema there s no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal in stanley kubrick s a space odyssey and indeed bartlett s opening sequence of images flashing colours before a close up human eye recalls dave bowman s journey through the stargate the visuals are richly coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though we re sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor there appears to be some confusion about the film s release date imdb lists the film as a release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film s completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a s music video and some brisk techno music wouldn t have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought and please don t laugh at this free thinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldn t possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality 
i stumbled across this act i by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this was nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at first my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such i don t think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused 
dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making the storyline across the parts blends mindless action slap stick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions it s hard to believe that there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode a must see movie for anyone who likes anime 
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kyser s mysteries would be a good example having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh o brien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads don t know if that was true all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i haven t seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
i ve spent years looking for a copy of this film mm dvd vhs so i could show it to my kids the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business they had to be that good to play that demented i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band when not fighting the fires there s the usual running gags plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra also comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight man hugh o brien 
the performance by om puri smita patil and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great i have not seen another movie like this it is one whole each piece so nicely fit in the plot you cannot not be impressed by this movie amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and baap of om puri om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty s at sadhashiv s place is absoulely stunning smita patil does not play a main role but her part is also not distracting from the main plot and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble he is also the guru of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema 
directed by govind nihalani this is definite cop film of indian cinema may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force politics with no holds barred how it effects on a young cop a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop bad cop hindi films but this is different today s generation which grown up watching dark realistic films like satya company may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn t pay much attention to such kind of cinema yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class mass audience when it released for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar its more than cop character he internalized a lot which is something original in acting watch his scenes with his father whom he hates smita whom he loves smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level my god what a natural expressions she carried shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me he s a brilliant character actor if given a chance here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen sadashiv amrapurkar as rama shetty it s another story that he didn t get such a meaty role almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra s b grade action films watch the scene where om st time becomes a rebel for his father played by amrish puri next both are sharing wine together how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love hate for each other two faces of indian police force masculinity impotency and in between lies half truth ardh satya kudos to nihalani s touch the film won national awards as best hindi feature film best actor om puri filmfare awards in best film best director best supporting actor categories recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films ratings 
after aakrosh this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like coolie betaab hero in smithapatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs at one time she even gave up her love when the hero s ruthlessness touched the roof top there was another character in this movie which was played by om puri contemporary naseeruddin shah he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero s ending in his debut film sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani s other film drohkaal even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew each one played their part par excellence 
 ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father s ideologies incidences of his father s atrocities on his mother anand s approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty s house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair raising moments the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly

i love this show every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is i am a huge sci fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science fiction show in the history of film tv there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion its amazing season after season the show gets better and better i ve been a fan of macgyver since i was now and i find it so ironic that my favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other back when i first saw stargate the movie i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci fi flicks then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited but didn t get showtime till the fifth season was almost over though i m disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead id say though that it turned out just fine maybe even better this show is amazing and i hope it never dies atlantis here we come 
any story comprises a premise characters and conflict characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a militant character readily lends oneself to this ardh satya s premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre the line goes ek palde mein napunsaktha doosre palde mein paurush aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ardh satya a rough translation the delicate balance of right wrong commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another is the needle on the center a half truth the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant it makes a deep impact on the protagonist lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow at the end of the film om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem the film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem however chitre s words are too powerful and at best the film matches up to the poem in every aspect 
the haunted world of edward d wood jr isn t a particularly good documentary aesthetically it s lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in cohesive but this adds to it s charm i say this because it s a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such there s really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall it s worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but don t expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after wood s own heart 
i originally caught this back in in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven t much changed documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include vampira dolores fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory walcott and paul marco interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed i ve seen all of wood s films and they re just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldn t say he was the worst director ever but he s down there do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didn t try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the s and s still it s of interest if you re a wood fan the best interviews are with vampira who tears wood apart and dolores fuller a long time girlfriend 
i loved this film not being a swooning ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed s we get insight into ed s personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person s legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood s legend in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling 
 the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan from outer space this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan companion failed it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed s life and untimely death for the viewer best watched at am while wearing an angora sweater 
this film deals with the atrocity in derry years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday the film is well researched acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the disgraceful white wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is 
an excellent and accurate film mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy once again mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew a great film 
the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the boss s daughter is not for all tastes but it s still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we ve come to know so well through other films from this region this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and i ve been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed 
i really like miikes movies about yakuza this one i saw about years ago and it really fu ed my head never before seen such a sick and twisted thing the story is good and the actors do their thing very well i haven t seen the uk or japan version but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored if you haven t seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria the i on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown i felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence that s what i like miike for 
anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike s work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director in keeping with miike s working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with what takes the movie out of the realms of the same old same old however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today s cinema and this isn t that nice cool clean violence so beloved of us cinema this stuff is nasty painful and hurts that said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities miike s sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you it doesn t have the ohmigod ending of dead or alive but if you re not squeamish now s the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio s new john woo shopping list 
i love jack s jokes like the clich is or over the top clich guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious daniel s starting to catch up on him to good thing jack s not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm mania i just love all the plots season a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i m starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and teal c it just all theoretically possible and exciting oops their i go again sorry i m also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think it s good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth 
the movie starts something like a less hyper kinetic more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers but when a police officer is killed one tatsuhito gets involved and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fast an earlier work of miike s shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though it s not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces rather it s a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost brothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning tatsuhito s brother is getting involved with said society so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm what s mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis wang tatsuhito is a japanese born in china later moved back into japan and alienated for it wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he s forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother while it would be rude to state that miike s movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes it s easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter dis impassioned characters polarisdib
while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike s later films this is a very good crime drama the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don t mind a no frantic pace a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semi graphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with caution or out of 
i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why one of the problems is the cultural language one here we have a chinese taiwanese japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences nevertheless it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one 
shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals why could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon should you see this film yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in doa of course great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd if i haven t put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i m sure it will come out in that country 
shinjuku triad society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber conventional realm it s a yakuza triad picture involving cops versus japanese or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical debut takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here on in social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one s roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive thumbing of the nose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rape violence towards women blood curdling violence it s certainly not as surreal as some of miike s most recent films but this is expected as he s trying out things that he s just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers it s got all of those qualities and it s also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fans the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as a eastwood esquire anti hero hero who s become a detective and another who s become a gangster or a would be one the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare time played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner karino takeshi caesar who s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie there s some intrigue involving the organ trading scheme with the gangsters which kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gang s penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won t come off if it doesn t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have it s par for the course of a film like this miike s goals are met though just met in his low scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters at the same time shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black comedy from the miike oeuvre some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area there s even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr weeny burger miike and his writer don t have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedy like ichi or of course visitor q but there s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters as the first entry of the black society trilogy as it s called i was quite impressed and it s a fine quasi calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema 
this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza the kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses the movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness if you ve only seen miikes far out movies ichi the killer fudoh etc this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy and as always with miike there are at least two scenes in this that you ll never forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself 
a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true miike film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich but like all clich s it is based on the truth all the miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character shinjuku is however one of miike s most perfectly formed films he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film as you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that the film has a fantastic pace unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle dead or alive also deals with similar issues miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past i cannot sing shinjuku s praises enough i do not want to give away too much this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano s sonatine the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you ll be popping it back on again to work it all out 
this was the beginning of it all granted this is not friends at its best but this was the show s pilot let s not forget and not a bad one at that we re introduced to the gang and central perk where our story begins even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says i just want to be married again and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back something else in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the so called flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was keep watching first season is a blast 
here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer aniston the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isn t always fantastic the acting in this episode isn t great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry who shine matt le blanc man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails david schimmer why does he over pronounce every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isn t confident and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the st season courtney cox looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this minute pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perry i m doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us 
and that s how the greatest comedy of tv started it has been years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season because that s where friends is based on quotes extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts let s say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoebe in our first meet we see how rachel dumps a guy in the church how understand monica s search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she s a lesbian till we meet joey phoebe and chandler in the next episodes enjoy friends 
stargate sg is a spin off of sorts from the movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack o neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is teal c a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into one s brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person s brain through the episodes we mostly get to see sg the exploratory team comprised of jack daniel teal c and sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are on world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth through the years you start to see a decline in the sg team as close knit and more character building story lines this in turn means even more on world episodes which is perfectly understandable my rating while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction 
the pilot is extremely well done it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes i don t think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and rachels future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice bravo a great start to an unbeatable comedy 
in the very first episode of friends which aired sept the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great song i would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the album cd it is on so i can purchase it i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be believable thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years 
in this first episode of friends we are introduced to the main characters of the series monica geller phoebe buffay chandler bing ross geller joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green we discover that rachel a rich girl that is monica s friend from high school times left her fianc barry at the altar since she discovered she didn t love him she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father getting a new job as a waitress in central perk ross for the other hand discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode monica in this episode makes out and eventually sleeps with paul the wine guy who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife but in reality he was just deceiving her ps i just loooove joey s and chandler s haircuts in this first season 
why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre come on yankies get your english up to par 
masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby julia anderson ciff addison martin donovan are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road cliff s airbag works ok he walks away with minor injuries unfortunately for abby hers didn t she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body abby s life is saved just she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured horribly disfigured from the burns cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin bersen thinks they should let abby die sue the car manufacturer get rich while abby s mum pam linda sorenson wants to blame cliff get rich save abby however abby has other plans of her own this american canadian co production was directed by rob schmidt whose only horror film previously was wrong turn which on it s own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode was episode from season of the masters of horror tv series while i didn t think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i ve seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same still doesn t come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn t anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i d say it s a bit uneven the first minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby s life the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart the character s are a bit clich d the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here there where it loses it s focus a bit i wasn t that keen on the ambiguous ending director schmidt does a good job there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere out and out blood gore there are some fantastic special make up effects as usual there s shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images make up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser it s sequels then there s the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close ups of scalpels slicing skin open him peeling it off the muscle putting it into a cooler box very messy there are also various assorted body parts there s some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant as most masters of horror episodes it doesn t look like a cheap made for tv show which basically if the truth be told it is the acting was fine but there s no big names in this one right to die is another enjoyable somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene well worth a watch for those with the stomach 
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore spoilers here top credits also go to the dead on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen playing the character in a great aloof fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not so good guy who gets his just desserts end of spoiler as a revenge from the dead flick right to die benefits heavily from it s performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour 
this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he kill em all they are often the victims screwfly solution pro life valerie on the stairs i don t remember the argento s episode in season etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i don t know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking 
i m not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badly the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple old fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband s continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbey s mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbey s hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff s surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv series concept like masters of horror it s violent and gory with a sick twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean spirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons 
well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season s entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes there s also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever 
a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him this comes to us from director rob schmidt who made wrong turn a film i have not seen with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting schmidt to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense my apologies to him for my underestimation as of episode in a episode season this was actually the best one yet the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this is only the foundation on which the story revolves once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense i was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of hellraiser in this through the first part of the show i had no idea what they were talking about then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of hellraiser however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than hellraiser some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look i didn t watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that it s confusing the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him he s somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story if you will i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but he s completely unlovable while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i m excited about the washingtonians episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the genre s future but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope this one is a keeper and please bring schmidt back for season 
stargate sg follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate in the stargate universe humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa uld such as ra and apophis for millennia the goa uld harvested humanity heavily influencing and spreading human cultures as a result earth cultures such as those of the aztecs mayans britons the norse mongols greeks and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy many well known mythical locations such as avalon camelot and atlantis are found or have at one time existed presently the earth stargate found at a dig site near giza in is housed in a top secret u s military base known as the sgc stargate command underneath cheyenne mountain col jack o neill anderson dr daniel jackson shanks capt samantha carter tapping and teal c judge compose the original sg team a few characters join and or leave the team in later seasons along with other sg teams they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa uld in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races the parasitic goa uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship throughout the first eight seasons the goa uld are the primary antagonists they are a race of highly intelligent ruthless snake like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species including humans the original arch enemy from this race was the system lord apophis peter williams other system lords such as baal and anubis play pivotal roles in the later seasons in the ninth season a new villain emerges the ori the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori their followers and their enemies the ancients 
fans of the hbo series tales from the crypt are going to love this moh episode those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely works donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and she s horribly burned in a fire he s reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days but abbey s never been one to give up without a fight and that s where the ec theme of the episode comes in cuckolded husbands and wives have always been the genre s favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception if anything the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere and that s not to mention that john esposito s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist you don t realize as you re watching that you only know half the story until close to the end think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas and you re there not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed as with most moh episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply 
i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this master really doesn t have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the season the acting was good i don t know how he wrangled it but we ve got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the series i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the hen pecked hubby really good effort like i ve said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future 
maybe it s just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin pardon the pun this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself some parts are very reminiscant of hellraiser but come off as tribute rather than imitation it s a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile this piece brings it and doesn t appologize i liked this one a lot do not watch whilst eating pudding 
this was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes if there is such a thing a man s wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving his airbag worked her s didn t she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes what more could you ask for you might ask well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces i just loved rob schmidt s wrong turn direction too he has a great knack for horror excellent episode this is one i m buying for sure 
but the fun is in the journey i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times yes it s predictable and yes it s a clich romantic comedy but the point is that it s a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it s weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way great date movie great movie for a happy cry 
this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesn t demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael rispoli he was in rounders too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun it s just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings i know sounds kooky but it is and that s what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you ll know 
as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but you ll never realize it until the end it s a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations it s a postcard of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you 
does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george ede aka father fitzpatrick in the move it had to be you he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie i also loved serendipity great love story for the soul i met my one true love my soulmate and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i wasn t ready for that kind of emotional relationship altho we did marry i wasn t mature enough to give as much as i thought i would i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for years he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry in disbelief about the way it turned out i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart years this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me i know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry don t ever get complacent and take true love for granted it has been the hardest lesson of my life also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting true love is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what it will happen nothing is impossible even when it s the second time around thanks 
i d have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural iowa oregon virginia l a etc are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian locale but if there ever were one deserving the top rating on this site it s this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one it s also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega stars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre i ve seen i caught it by chance on a mid day friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week i d never run across this flick in the years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman anna s mother whom i d seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlie s best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a sub story romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oft done plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances it checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in caps this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles i love films with a harder edge rounders the escapist schwarzenegger stallone fare goodfellows even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by you ve got mail and sleepless in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn t have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the co stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega films as well 
a sweet funny story of people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins 
it s amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow stargate sg is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with star trek as the kings of sci fi following on from the feature film stargate this series sees stargate command a military science organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore sg is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack o neill and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal c who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa uld a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods the top notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o neill who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye michael shanks as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed amanda tapping as carter has perfected the balance between depicting her character s femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal c who is able to depict the character s emotions with subtlety and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between o neill and jackson guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn t bore viewers sg also excels in humour from o neill s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd sg has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death it isn t just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show overall 
sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich s but it s entertaining and that s what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty can t be disguised as for michael vartan i m sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i don t understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see olivia d abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if d abo s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadn t really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception it s a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube that s why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey i m a sentimental guy who tears up easily don t get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those i give it only because i m saving my for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think you ll like it 
a beautiful postcard of new york the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear it never did my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch 
i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday on lifetime movie channel jim larson s comments about it being a sweet funny story of people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldn t get a bonus everyone else sro for making the movie anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it natasha s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for god bless her her family and future endeavors this movie doesn t seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too 
i caught this film at a test screening was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story well acted natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts the male lead was awsome very funny film takes place in the best locations in new york made me want to go there i just saw you ve got mail i thought it had to be you was a much better story fresher it was clean and great for whole family i think it will do well audience i saw it with loved it a definite recommend 
this is the first michael vartan movie i ve seen i haven t seen alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clich s and the story doesn t ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don t think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good 
i just can t understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boy meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by henstridge talk about winning the gene pool lottery is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan holds his own there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together ignore the negative comments if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be euphoric ps i am male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess 
this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than why not it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most like our churches the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians thanks fox for producing it as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith 
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all 
johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories the music is great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like i ve been there too and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion cash s narration is good too but the actor who played jesus was miscast there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music because it is uncompelling i doubt we ll see this ever widely distributed again i d love to buy the cd tom paine texas usa
there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that jesus was blond the last supper was a huge meal he liked playing with the children his death was for all people and for all time the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons 
i wait for each new episode each re run with anticipation the new look of sci fi created by stargate sg is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool 
i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b rated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out 
i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting who da thunk it parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser films a movie like this never gets its dues from close minded males it s too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting and its depiction of contemporary l a and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made l a look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie i won t divulge the plot but as a long time and hard core atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light hearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyable this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy however if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc you ll enjoy this a first rate job all around even if it s kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesn t detract from the movie s overall excellence 
ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so i m writing this from a girl s perspective i think it s a shame it only scored in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because i m female i don t enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good one liners fine acting although eva longoria parker s character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs 
this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool i ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i ve seen in the two weeks jason bigg s character was the best though even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning this may be a romantic comedy and i don t like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool this film scored pretty high out of all the movie s i ve seen lately and the rest were big budget or better publicized good job in writing 
this is a great film i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it excpet mike from friends but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and witty paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking apocalypse now here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets everyone has their own tastes but i really don t understand the one star reviews for this 
actually my vote is a anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it don t misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends i think that not exactly but who cares also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr rock won with his movie i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher however the film is good 
i watched this on an hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don t get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn t as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay but not gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn t really very funny in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call 
i wasn t a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i m reviewing this movie from a guy s persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it 
look it s eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend it s gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore sex panther cologne in anchorman if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies however if you are willing to suspend reality for minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you ve come to the right place the characters are all funny they work together very well the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell he s as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i 
over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny there were a few clich s but i found most stuff fresh at first i didn t think it was going to be good at all when it started out if you can get past the first minutes though the movie starts getting more interesting this film wasn t burst out in laughter hilarious and wasn t oh my gosh wonderful it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i don t see how this movie was bad it s rating is just a bit too low i could ve dealt with a but a also giving this movie a is disgraceful it was pretty good and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a which is what most people gave it 
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full vote if claudia black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly vela has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didn t need this great series turned into new episodes of farscape i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clich s obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promised however after minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with only one toilet humour gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilarious the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tall sure you aren t going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time 
once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a soviet era poster saying ne boltay meaning don t gossip i translated it for the generation of tv watchers as don t be gladys kravitz in reference to the nosy neighbor on bewitched however when you see the result of gossip in the pvt snafu short rumors you see that it s not quite a laughing matter in this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states so he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to snafu well you know what i mean yes it s mostly wwii propaganda complete with a derogatory term for the japanese but i have to say that the pvt snafu shorts were actually quite funny of course since they had dr seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices it s no surprise that these came out rather cool worth seeing 
friz freleng s rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic inducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country s military rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured don t badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts 
rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring private snafu the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros termite terrace including friz freleng chuck jones and carl stalling the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel i e dr seuss the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope the little twerp who would do everything you re not supposed to do according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good of course as the title would indicate this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors the setting is an army camp private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you won t see in any other hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air i e balloon juice a soldier shoots his mouth off cannon style and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction winged baloney at that panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized coney island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn and the japanese are in california the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for rumor itis and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell this is a highly effective piece of work the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one in recent years we ve seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances because the technology has improved the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e mail cellphones and blogging consequently rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn t feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever 
this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called pvt snafu all of us have imaginations along with fears and what have you and that s what happens here as pvt snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy that s still being done today we lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven t learned this cartoon may be years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan amazing the writer the famous dr suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever nothing hilarious here but it wasn t meant to be you have to understand the climate of and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven s style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can t be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste de grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than years when you ll leave the cinema you ll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more 
tim krabbe is the praised author of het gouden ei a novel that was put on the screen twice spoorloos and the vanishing one of the dutch writer s more recent works is de grot a psychological thriller about two totally different men egon and axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life egon is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing geography books axel on the other hand is a charismatic party animal a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday s concern is to get a woman into his bedroom from the moment they meet axel has a strong influence on egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like egon ultimately egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it in my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character s background to really care for him or her another complaint was the fact that the main characters egon and axel are a little stereotypical egon is the dull intellectual while axel is his exact opposite in real life such one dimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting fedja van huet egon is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve the drawbacks of the film however are the same as the book s mainly because the characters are one dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying guess who wrote the script indeed krabbe himself it is obvious that this talented director that s what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book 
 de grot is a terrific dutch thriller based on the book written by tim krabb another of his books het gouden ei was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called spoorloos the vanishing in this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called the vanishing but there are times it comes close especially the opening moments are terrific we see a man later we learn his name is egon wagter fedja van hu t coming from a plane in thailand when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border these scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like this from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward we see how egon still as a child here played by erik van der horst befriends a guy named axel as a kid played by benja bruijning we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how axel as an adult played by marcel hensema became a criminal egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him the movie is chronological in a way it shows egon and axel as kids than as students young adults and in their mid thirties but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults minor spoilers herein the title means the cave and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy like the beginning the ending is terrific the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well 
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven s style is less business like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can t be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste de grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than years when you ll leave the cinema you ll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more 
de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb who also adapted this story for the screen some really top class acting not only by van hu t but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must see especially if you liked spoorloos the vanishing s original screen adaptation 
i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some sci fi show while waiting for the bsg new season but after few episodes i became a fan i ve loved the characters the not so stupid as you think he is jack o neill the not only smart samantha carter the glorious teal c women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel jackson of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly it s not about technology or space fighting it s about helping your friend even risking your life for him it s about we don t leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human human and now it s breaking a record going th season and still doing good 
indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like laggan where henpecked castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots devdas a hapless fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one s feelings or sentiments alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry but to make a good movie you have to tight rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar narasimhan nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won t sell a sad but true state of affairs faster this changes better for bollywood all said and done this is one good movie 
i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought hey another film starring aishu and shah rukh little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just minutes shakti is a film about a mother s love and endurance it s a film about transformations ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie it s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him the title of the song is ishq kamina loosely translated as love s a bitch and it is just plain smoking hot don t miss it 
good movie good music good background and an acceptable plot but the main point again as his movies tend to be the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold nana patekar this may be his second best performance after parinda others may disagree although other movies are not far behind one man that will never ever disappoint you good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without you can see in his movies others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins but this man is really something elase the movie is cool the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good a must watch 
this is probably karisma at her best apart from zubeidaa nana patekar also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it could ve been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including karima s mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch her the sets were also pretty good i didn t really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india it s as real as it gets overall i would give it a thumbs up 
a strong woman oriented subject after long director krishna vamsi s shakti the power the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi s first home production a story about a woman s fight against harsh injustice the story of the film revolves around nandini karisma kapoor who lives in canada with her two uncles tiku talsania jaspal bhatti there she meets shekhar sanjay kapoor falls in love with him and they soon marry their family is complete when nandini has a boy raja master jai gidwani but their happiness is short lived as the news of shekhar s ailing mother deepti naval makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india and that s when the problems start from the moment they reach india both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere they take a crowded train to reach shekhar s village and when they finally reach the station they have to catch a long bus drive to his village the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never ending drive and unfortunately for them a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus fortunately they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him after that they drive to the handing havel where shekhar s father narsimha nana patekar lives with his wife deepti naval nandani realized that her father in law is in command as soon as she enters the place but her only solace is her mother in law s warm welcome living there nandini learns of her father in laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him the day she sees her father in law teach her son to throw a bomb she loses it and lashes out against him insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father in law her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart wrenching film what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie the only drawback is ismail darbar s music which fails to rise above the script the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena which has been composed by anu malik another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he s shown his versatility once again with this role sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors deepti naval too is in top form and her pr climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy shahrukh s cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he s been pulled in to get the required star value though his role was not really required he s done it well overall shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr release hype is sure to get it a good opening shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least reels to better the impact shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch 
seeing this movie was the most fun i ve had at the cinema in a long time however i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied this picture has everything any movie could ever have it has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an absurdist self conscious art film it s all in there adding up to a myth the basic premise is about an indian couple nandini karishma kapoor and shekhar sanjay kapoor happily living in canada who rush to india to visit the husband s parents after a disturbing news report the rest of the story takes place in india where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence at one point the story borrows from not without my baby but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions including shah rukh khan s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie in fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only shah rukh ends up being a real character yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the film s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion another notable presence is nana patekar who plays narsimha the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar nana patekar dominates every scene he s in with a scary but nuanced character the movie is not without its share of realism violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions at times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic i have seen a share of bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm but shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained it is pure gratuitous cinema and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book perhaps the all important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind but i came out of watching shakti exhilarated making movies can be the most fun in the world 
okay i know this does nt project india in a good light but the overall theme of the movie is not india it s shakti the power of a warlord and the power of a mother the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth then things go terribly wrong the interaction between nandini and her father in law the power of their dysfunctional relationship and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie shah rukh khan s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax the musical interludes are strengths believable and well done 
well i ll be honest it is not exactly a sholay but you cant get a sholay every week in fact you could see distinct signatures of not without my daughter sally field in this movie however as most inspired movies go this one was a well inspired one well handled and well done nana patekar as usual tends to overdo his hysterics but all others are commendable specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time but she hasn t lost any of her grace in fact she has performed much better that when i last saw her another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age all in all a nice watch 
the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother s love the exceptional performances the steady execution and the quite innovative script the film tells the story of an indian woman nandini who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to india when they get into the village nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar s family ruled by his cruel highly cynical and merciless father narasimha lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home but he is soon killed by his father s enemies when she wants to leave narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india here starts the intense struggle which can be called nandini vs narasimha india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas so it may be even correct the portrayal is in my view fair and not one sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world the locations are amazing the music is wonderful and krishna vamshi s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing one thing that must be noted is the very ear pleasing background score by ismail darbar it is beautiful the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film portrayed realistically throughout the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch its dialogues are superb and intelligently written and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension the film s biggest strength is the performances karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible she displays so much intensity impulsiveness anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child after fiza this is her most powerful performance one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him patekar displays cruelty wittiness and even humanity with total conviction he is outstanding another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india s most underrated actress deepti naval who sensitises her character to perfection sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief anyway do watch shakti it could have been better but it is definitely a must watch 
if any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one i ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting comically with the police officers the ishq kamina song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag about i have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact karisma kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza she looks pretty in the first half and i ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date nana patekar was excellent as her father in law not much to say about him besides this is a role made for him deepti naval as the mother in law was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesn t have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewer s eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances sanjay kapoor was all right but he didn t have much to do shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy aish is mad hot however the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for aish but they won t brag too much about it after wards hum tum miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see 
the movie was sub par but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci fi fans ideal program the actors deliver and the special effects for a television series are spectacular having an intelligent interesting script doesn t hurt either stargate sg is currently one of my favorite programs 
uneven bollywood drama karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend sanjay kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller film is compelling its few song dance numbers are uninteresting and needless the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film s drama at least once we ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy go lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance are dispensed with his throw away comic book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film s primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay s sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but sanjay himself overacts terribly especially during obvious ad libs the directorial style of writer director krishna wamsi is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical underscore is also quite effective moody featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti s soundtrack cd but bollywood hasn t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but shakti is karisma kapoor s film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes despite the unevenness of much of the picture karisma s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette both of which i d seen just prior although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family here living in the austerity of terrorism controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china s tang dynasty whose self serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext 
what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band this disc is not for the faint of heart the music is incredibly intense and very cool what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long it is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap in when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands and audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise try the concert out it really is amazing 
this is the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork who s next which would provide anthems like baba o reily and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the s daltrey shows what being a front man is all about entwistle steady as ever moon is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side saddle whilst having a bass drum head replaced townsend even looks like he s enjoying himself occasionally considering they took to the stage at am no one in the crowd was asleep there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one 
this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle the original drum and bass there seems to be very little early who footage around these days if there is more then lets be aving it now a days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether a parody a shadow of their much better years to be fair not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore they ve earned their respect and with overtime this concert footage for me is one of their best to command an audience of around a plus strong crowed takes skill charisma wit and a whole lot of bloody good music we all know of the other acts on the bill the doors their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died moody blues hendrix taste free and many more the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the s woodstock the film and record had come out and so had the who s greatest work to date tommy the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste to be able to experience their own unique event to be able to grove and love in the knowledge that this gig was their own to do this you needed the best of what rock n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd at two o clock in the morning in late august the m c announces ladies and gentlemen a small rock n roll band from shepherds bush london the oo john entwistle s body suit is of black leather on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel s and long flowing hair keith in a white t shirt and jeans as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he d preferred to wear the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours performing theirs and other artists greatest tracks such as young man blues shaking all over and then as on queue keith baiting the crowed to shut up it s a bleeding opera with tommy the rock opera the crowed went wild this is what they had come to hear and the who didn t disappoint straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of tommy can you hear me amazing to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english linear pcm stereo were as in the states i think you can get it with at least check local press for details on that okay the duration of the dvd is minutes with no extras which is a disappointment yes for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be live raw and in your face i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn t for the lack of and some extras would have been nice thanks roger pete john and keith 
this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as mitchell in malta at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger mitchell being mitchell the film wouldn t have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either oh well at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst i can t imagine watching it on it s own however 
joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material and almost always under appreciated he s been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of strong solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor and that s what s so great about him he really seems to mean what he s saying regardless of how clich obvious or silly which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones oliver reed and don stroud it s what made the walking tall trilogy work so well and that same magic is here in final justice this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the s and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era by moving the action from texas to europe there s a real timeless quality that doesn t jar you away from the action on screen to be honest i ve always enjoyed the films of greydon clark who is a no nonsense director in the same vein as s clint eastwood and this is one of his best final justice is one of the lost gems of the late s similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence i suppose if they remake this with the rock a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do 
kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie panaghoy sa suba is very good it has the drama the action the romance and scene that will make you laugh while the story is not that original a love triangle or make a four cornered love japanese occupation rebellion american as lord its presentation is something cool especially it uses it original language bisaya for the filipino nipongo for the japanese and english for the american this movie will go as one of this year s best pinoy movies go watch this 
well it s been a long year and i m down to reviewing the final film for panaghoy sa suba call of the river placed second in the recent metro manila film festival as expected it didn t do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director his great vision and creativity really helped this film he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio she did a great job portraying bikay the younger sister of duroy i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her some of the camera shots in the film were done very well the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film i certainly won t be raving about the story of this film 
i m grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once moribund visayan film understorey panaghoy is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular that claims more speakers than tagalog the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines downside the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist the other item that i didn t appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the period costume of the same character and above all his bright red kit car that i suppose was meant to pass for a s roadster without those small yet glaring details panaghoy would ve been at least a out of on my rating daghang salamat manoy cesar addendum this film sure beats peque gallaga s oro plata mata which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war alos there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg s the color purple and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of noli me tangere 
as a kid i loved this game i played it a zillion times during spring with my friend andrew i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored then streets of rage came out and we quickly forgot that this one even existed you play as ex cops axel stone adam or blaze fielding who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way there are levels to work thru in a run down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x beating up all the bad guys and the end of level boss is much fun level the bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river you even have the chance to become mr x s right hand man at the end of the game at a price this leads to the bad ending in which you become the the boss of the syndicate exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr x but never mind streets of rage also has truly fantastic music the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis the main theme level one level and final boss are standout tunes as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console but with streets of rage also available it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete pros average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game great tunes easy to get into and hard to put down cons vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage poor enemy ai baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat this is especially infuriating with the level boss lack of combo moves lack of decent weapons bad guy models are repeated far too often graphics b sound a gameplay b lasting appeal b 
on sunday july the first episode of a new science fiction series called stargate sg was broadcast on showtime a spin off of and sequel to the film stargate starring kurt russell and james spader the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film for ten seasons it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg originally the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o neill two l s michael shanks as dr daniel jackson amanda tapping as captain samantha carter christopher judge as teal c and don s davis as major general george s hammond for ten long years we watched the team battle against the goa uld the replicators the ori and many other aggressors at the same time they forged alliances with the asgard the tok ra the rebel jaffa the nox and the tollan they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up not until death claimed them and sometimes not even then as with all long running series they were numerous cast changes michael shanks left the series in january at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor daniel jackson s successor as the team s resident archaeologist geek was jonas quinn an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara played by corin nemec however shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june and nemec left at the same time unfortunately he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards don s davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march as he felt that it was time for him to go the show s original star and arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons he finally left sg in march in order to spend more time with his then six year old daughter jack o neill was by far my favourite character in the series and truth be told i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason the ninth season represented a new era for the programme with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa uld and the replicators in season eight many fans felt the series should go out on a high regardless the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa uld as the series main adversaries three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re invention ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt colonel cameron mitchell the new leader of sg his farscape co star the lovely claudia black began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious sexy hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran a former goa uld host and con artist from another planet a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o neill and general hammond for the last two years they starred alongside the sg faithful michael shanks amanda tapping and christopher judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise alas all good things must come to an end during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting in cancellation in its august after ten seasons and episodes the dream was finally over on march what began with children of the gods ended with unending the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci fi channel in the united states on june in the ten years that the series was on the air it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek in terms of popularity in certain countries it became the second longest running sci fi series in the world second only to doctor who and the longest running american produced sci fi series having surpassed the x files only a few months before it ended stargate sg represents the cornerstone of the stargate franchise in its success and popularity led to the production of a spin off series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and episodes in august although plans for another feature film fell through two direct to dvd films stargate the ark of truth and stargate continuum were released in and more are planned for the not too distant future a third live action series stargate universe is also due to premiere at some point next year there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran only from to but the less said about that the better despite the end of sg and atlantis as continuing series the future of stargate looks very bright indeed in conclusion while stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci fi television franchises such as star trek and doctor who its still relatively new compared to those two sci fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many many years to come 
imdb lists this as for some reason but the other sources i ve seen including the excellent program notes mark it as doesn t really matter except that it s quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in released the same year pure abstraction isn t really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the s and deserves to be better known 
all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done it may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way would you expect perfection in hell it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose it was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get i hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori i don t think lady death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong no pun intended 
it s a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn t done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer himself then she seeks revenge and the rest you better see it from the movie i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics but one way or another it s the story of lady death 
i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating s some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you don t like comic books or animation then of course you won t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and heroic sexy women kicking butt and saving the world hell you will love this movie i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie quite anime esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation like titan a e meet s the live action version of punisher in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie 
i love the movies and own the comics the comics are different then the movie but still i d give it out of it was awesome if the movies got anymore awesome i would have her babies and i am female read the comics you won t regret it yes in this movie since brian p the artist for her died we don t get nearly as good artistic work i mean seriously don t get me wrong these people did great but different versions for different people different strokes for different folks as the saying goes any guy who doesn t go bonkers over her is insane or does not like women or you know just plan insane if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure but hey there is always toes 
although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance the animation was ok i got the sense of the s anime from it which is what set it off for me why everyone else hates that is beyond me character development was fine i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around for you who don t like it obviously wasn t paying attention lucifer tells you how it happens and she used his words creamtor was a nice mentor soldier for her his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d
rented this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didn t find out until i got home watched it anyways absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to everyone the story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together the actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job gotta find a copy somewhere 
in my years of attending film festivals i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the bins at walmart i just found dvd of yank tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rock bottom remainder i loved this film wish i d seen it at the cinema in it s everything i d have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly it s good for americans to stretch a little if the film s title helps the us audience to explore random chaos all the better cinema imitates life visa versa also i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars come on the euro is not hard to figure out make the gringo audiences do the math seeing a film especially one shot in paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer director as well 
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema the story is enchanting the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie 
seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers perhaps it s because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth or are we missing something i d watch it again if i had some incentive so what s a happenstance to the french it is le battement d ailes du papillon serendipity fate perhaps it s an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings we ve all had these it s called life but when looked at in this way you begin to get the feeling that random might be more like fated a happenstance in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble all these incidents cause other events that well you get the picture dominoes multiply those by characters and an average of each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen and i think that there s a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this but then this is the magic world of cinema we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape here s the place to do it or if you re recovering from surgery and aren t going anywhere anyway this will engage you while your stitches are healing happenstance will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following stranger things have happened soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences meeting your first love finding the perfect gift your last auto accident you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it that s the answer i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain happenstance to me 
 happenstance is the most new york feeling parisian film i ve seen since when the cat s away chacun cherche son chat a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for amelie its french title is more apt le battement d ailes du papillon the beating of the butterfly s wings as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives tatou s gamine ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures and because she s part of a large multi ethnic ensemble so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn t sure if they were doing that or not but i loved how urban the coincidences were from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around caf s the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once originally written 
 stargate sg follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole having seen this series sporadically for it s first few seasons when it first came out i didn t know how good this series would really be years after i had last seen an episode my old impression was that the series was great but my impression was far from the truth stargate sg is more than just a simple sci fi series it is one of the most well made interesting long running exciting sci fi ever produced and why because it runs on an amazing premise this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise is able to provide something that doesn t work on the time restriction of film the sense of familiarity created by a long running series watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief and it s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show stargate sg kept offering great adventures throughout the years but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show the first few seasons perhaps up to the th th focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul d threat from the th to the th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul d and preventing attacks on earth after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg in a place of goaul d replicator ori conflicts the th season is probably the most mixed one it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments the th and th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o neil they are both good continuations although the first few episodes of the th season are a little weak because they seem to be about little more than sg and human jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori basically after season exploration was pushed to the background which in many ways was a shame because of the potential and mystery each planet episode presented on the other hand it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest the feeling i have is that it could go on the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome but ultimately things are as they are in the end because of the fact that i enjoyed everything it s a little hard to find that it ends the big picture however the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of years is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg 
this isn t exactly a great film but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different the film s main theme is fate and small seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors though instead of focusing on one random event seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion plus an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene like he s some sort of omnipotent being but there s absolutely no explanation of him in the film like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou this is capitalize on her success in amelie though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role the pace is brisk the acting fine and the conclusion isn t bad at all the only reason i didn t score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots 
narratives whether written visual or poetic epics generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers after all can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who this is especially true in film i think simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema viewers like myself however don t have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou a french actress whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain and later in a very long engagement both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity now other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player short cuts gosford park and others paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia stanley kramer did it with a mad mad mad mad world in a comedy of almost epic proportions the difference with this film is first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer s memory as the story flip flops between different time periods the basic the core so to speak story concerns a young woman irene tautou who is told by a fellow commuter on a train that she will meet her true love on that day this occurs in the first few minutes of the film the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn t realize that the young man opposite gilbert robin may be that one true love and nor does he they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter however chaos results throughout the rest of the day not only for the two young people but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere and yet if the story were simply that it could tend to be boring and even quite predictable not so the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace but which are turned into believable extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again for example the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours consider your alternatives two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen consider again what would happen all of that is interesting enough what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene or whether it was in fact the young man on the train that kept me guessing for a while i ll let you think about that should you see this delightful romp recommended for all 
this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie i ve ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply wonderful i found this movie delightful even with it s french taking itself too seriously deep meanings thing going on i loved it it s a great love story and i loved the way algerians were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great i want the cd 
this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular amelie both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role laurent firode the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory the film deals with chance as its english title indicates the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly as well as hurricanes in the pacific something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects from the start the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other something that is hard to imagine but in the film s context seems to work well a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film irene who is going to work is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper irene it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day after irene leaves the train the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene it seems they are destined to one another from the start but alas they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film audrey tautou is wonderful as irene faudel who plays younes doesn t have a lot to do until the end but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film which is as light as butterfly wings we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected 
to me this review may contain spoilers but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers i just watched this movie again and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie ever ever ever the real translation the beating of the butterfly s wings is oddly not used as the translated title i suppose they thought most americans wouldn t know what chaos theory is except for those who saw or read jurassic park the movie is based on chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events which all lead back to one event the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about in a way the ending seems inevitable despite this but if you think about it it is a perfect ending think to yourself what else needed to be said it is at the same time a very brave ending too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood 
most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character it is not really audrey tautou s real life personality hence every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part part etc now with that said i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it yes it s true there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn t seen at all for maybe min but i didn t even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters the guy who lies about everything is too funny the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss actually getting into all the characters here could take quite a while but this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a while audrey tautou s character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was in fact as irene her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first in this film irene is a girl with good intentions but over the course of a very awful day her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building very entertaining to watch great scenery and shots very colorful and never too slow and all of the characters can actually act the best part of the movie comes with about minutes left this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense and the whole butterfly effect blossoms i swear it was the best minutes of film i ve seen in quite a while and the ending it made me think damn i really lucked out finding this movie the ending to this movie is top notch whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant because not only are there all these other subplots going on but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect very impressive i highly suggest this movie as it s a great film to watch anytime in any mood with any company or alone 
the mystery here is why this delightful small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations it s rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and unlike some of its more critically acclaimed competition in the genre such as the taste of others it actually entertains 
the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific according to this theory somehow related to the chaos theory i m not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters most of them in paris whose actions will affect each others lives the six degrees of separation theory can be applied as well each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film the acting is finely tuned and nuanced audrey tautou is luminous the stories mesh plausibly the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement 
we have to remember that the s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don t who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy this one is a pip it s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father s estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he s initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it s hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene i can t explain it not even to myself but i gave this pile of trash an i m familiar with the term it s so bad it s good but i don t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody s basement

the first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clich d stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it s characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson peter deluise joseph malozzie and paul mullie richard s dry sense of humour makes to show so much better peter s directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you won t like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes the other side a good serious episode and window of opportunity a classic comic relief episode 
that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say it s funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally too only two of the sisters are really bad boy are they bad too one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e er she goes the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe she has those sensual slightly parted lips and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the other all three sisters are played by starlets the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield he had something of a career this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft core porn ever marketed well of course not the first but the raciest at that time the girls wear as little as possible and let s not forget about the female audience members bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor whose fetish was this bare chested he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit there s a real plot here too the girls family see is cursed they are prone to suicide or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide the movie is not bad i truly don t know where it was shown maybe it was made for drive ins somehow and i could be wrong i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here the women are scantily dressed they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels but the guy seems to be the central focus not everyone in the movie likes him but all the girls love him and i think the audience is meant to also it s lots of fun and on its own terms too 
faith and mortality viewed through the lens of an elderly ashkenazi jewish american gentleman and a younger african american jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years mostel s character is a tailor with chronic back problems and a terminally ill wife belafonte s character is a career hustler never settling on a regular job and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory he must convince mostel to renew his faith as it has been failing along with his wife s health and his own but belafonte s levine has his own problems still pining for the girlfriend he left behind belafonte s character leaves the film before he seemingly should and so the the ending is cryptic and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending this is not a typical hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person s crisis of faith it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors 
the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine it s one interesting twist on the themes from it s a wonderful life zero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working kaminsky is mostly bedridden he s reduced to applying for welfare in desperation like jimmy stewart he cries out to god for some help now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently but even stewart had trouble accepting travers but travers had one thing going for him he was over years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone god sent mostel something quite different the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment belafonte hasn t accepted he s moved on from life he s still got a lot of issues he also has a wife gloria foster who doesn t know he s passed on hit by a car right at the beginning of the film you put his issues and mostel s issues and you ve got a good conflict starting with the fact that mostel can t believe in a black jew named levine this was the farewell performance for polish jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo o shea playing a nice jewish doctor remembering o shea s brogue from the verdict i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor the angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society it s brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud make sure to catch it when broadcast 
 some spoilers i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms acting dated dialogue unclear storyline unfounded belafonte is great as a brandoesque menacing swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill equipped from his past life to do so he learns too late how empty his hustling materialistic life was without love mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny in spite of his prayers for a miracle his bitterness prevents him from accepting or believing in one the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other the result being hilarious and touchingly sad the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film after looking everywhere for belafonte mostel looks up to see a falling feather and he frantically reaches for it as if he s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles but belafonte wasn t allowed to finish his miracle either to restore fanny s health or mostel s faith so he never got his wings the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel s grasp a metaphor for both men s live it s too late and you don t get a second chance like it s a wonderful life this movie is magical wonderful funny but terribly tragic 
 and i do mean it if not literally after all i have not seen every movie ever created at least obviously among the ones the many i know the rule of thumb with imdb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example the piece of kannes kompetition krowned korean kraap called oldboy can be truly bad but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under this movie very much worth watching is a disgrace true i give it a in protest the movie is not perfect its true rating should be an or a it has some acting flaws belafonte especially the script wanders around sometimes however what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times the czech jan kadar directing two of the greatest actors of all time the beloved larger than life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting poetic moral tour de force a pair made in heaven it s true that this movie little flaws apart does not pander to the average audiences but those interested in watching an excellent while again not beyond criticism movie of the incomparable director who gave us the shop on the main street the best movie ever about holocaust should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that american beauty is better than the angel levine it isn t 
i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film as it s obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see it the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can it s an ok monster flick compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made way better 
i was around when i saw this movie first it wasn t so special then but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun a lot i think the best parts of the film are yeti s body language and the special effects also if you wanna watch this movie don t wait for a hollywood made blockbuster even this film was made from approx dollars i ve a copy of it movie and video version as well but i don t think it had been ever shown in cinemas watch it enjoy it yeti for ever 
most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm not so this gloriously bent batty and berserk over the top italian made shot in canada kitsch gut buster it s a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over baked what the hell s going on crackpot excess and inanity a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a foot yeti that resembles a hirsute s disco stud complete with jumbo wavy afro perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice they dethaw the beast jolt him back to life with electric charges grossly mistreat him and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth before you can say hey the filmmakers are obviously ripping off king kong our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen the gorgeous pheonix grant he lays lustful eyes on and storms away with his new lady love the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience of course he breaks free again nabs the vixen and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage the sublimely stupid dialogue sample line philosophy has no place in science professor cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw dropping awfulness clunky mis direction and a heavy handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere is the yeti a man or a beast ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen better still we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti s nipples which causes it to harden and elicits a big leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth the vixen nurses the yeti s wounded hand while he makes goo goo eyes at her the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building and the furry fellow even breaks a man s neck with his toes overall this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that s eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following 
being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decent decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giant monster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film by far yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert and really he s not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesn t even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and he s pretty much in the whole movie and in typical low budget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there s even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there yes the special effects aren t the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad movie yeti never stoops as low as say a p e does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti s nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isn t that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesn t get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong rip offs like a p e and queen kong by very far 
yeti deserves the star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made i saw it at a midnight screening in l a and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill fitting suit the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen and yes there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and he s mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti once he thaws which takes forever and he is instantly in love with her what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes bedroom eyes at her it s like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie in fact once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest she accidentally touches the yeti s nipple and yes the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard yikes of all yikes plus there s a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie there s also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl s hair gee thanks yeti now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout you re the best this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up if you are a fan of classic cinema crap seek this baby out 
stargate is the best show ever all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles i love the connection between the characters if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can t be because it is completely different i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time which is highly depressing however this program is very very good and is a must see but be warned it is highly addictive so in summery i love stargate and amanda tapping 
people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs congo king kong vs godzilla king kong they all ripoff one another but yeti stands on its own it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal s attraction with one female the yeti myth is based on bigfoot not like king kong and archeologists have been fascinated it at one time they did exist but there is no scientific data to prove it this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it the first time i watched it was on elvira s mistress of the dark shows in the early s it sent chills down my spine as a kid especially when the yeti got mad i saw it again around am on abc about to yrs ago seeing it again made me appreciate it more it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes also the music is pretty cool its very yeti like gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere vote and half out of 
here s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jackson s miserable computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi s city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyes the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster who s size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie it s here that the film won me over it s enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in and god s gun the year before this was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action adventure genre film scene from the s s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn t have worked which is exactly why peter jackson s movie sucked he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all it s faults clunkiness kramer s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid it s about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i d rather go out with a smile on my face 
having seen most of ringo lam s films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual it s a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest china town in north america like i do if you can find it don t pass it up 
i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies but all of them failed to meet my expectations until now burning paradise doesn t contain the flat humor most hk movies have nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film the story is not complex but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie from the first one which is one of the coolest i have ever seen yet so short to the last main scenes but mind there s also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half decapitated etc the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall yep it s not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film it s ringo lam and i m sure as hell going to check out more from this director ace 
 burning paradise is a combination of neo shaw brothers action and ringo lam s urban cynicism when one watches the film they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn t matter it s attitude and atmosphere that counts this great film has both always trying to be different than his contemporaries lam gives us to traditional heroes fong sai yuk and hung shi kwan and puts them in a raiders of the lost ark setting however these are not the light hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime there is no holding back too bad they don t make films like this more often 
an unusual film from ringo lam and one that s strangely under appreciated the mix of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse several horses get chopped up it s very unexpected the story is very simple fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak blood is everywhere the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it s never bad enough to ruin the film find this one it s one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties just remember it s not child friendly 
hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood 
this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong s new wave that began with tsui hark s zu warriors of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new wave s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burning paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance it s not that there isn t humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw but this is just as humans are not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time when irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of red lotus temple who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before he is the very incarnation of milton s satan from paradise lost better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he can t get to satan s hell soon enough he ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule that s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it s not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as all encompassing reality thus there s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in charge of course fortunately the film doesn t end there though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all 
people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but i m glad to say this movie isn t one of them over nine million dollars which i don t think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didn t think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years 
i disagree with anyone who done t like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do it s sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didn t have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish s and dreams can come true tear tear i love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i m glad that at least some people liked it 
this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years i will sadly miss it although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit the last ever episode of sg on television anyway was beautifully done robert wrote something that felt close to reality as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up s and downs but over the years they ve turned into a family i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else s criticisms sg was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement the wonderful characters stories directors writers from episode one i was hooked the blend of action science drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them i never want the show to die stargate sg 
genre dinosaur animation new york time travel circus main characters rex the tyrannosaurus rex elsa the pterodactyl dweeb the parasarolophus ooo the triceratops a boy called louis a girl called cecilia and captain new eyes actors john goodman rex yeardley smith cecilia martin short stubbs the clown felicity kendal elsa etc what happens four dinosaurs see above are fed some brain grain cereal and are now cuddly friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children they go into new york with big plans my thoughts this is a cute animated film the animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not so good but they look pleasant all the same that way i like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly they are nice friendly and good i like almost all the characters featured especially elsa and cecilia but of course i like the others as well overall i like this film a lot recommended to people who like good children s animated films people who like dinosaurs john goodman and people who think that circuses aren t always what they seem enjoy 
i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was flabbergasted when i saw the rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesn t wow me as much at but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and won t mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like screweyes s death which still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james horner is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters louie is probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin short s clown was both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tells screweyes i quit had me in stitches my favourite is screweyes though an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could ve been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscar worthy has its funny and heart warming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short rhea perlman felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable all in all this is a good movie i don t get the rating honestly i don t sure this film isn t perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun bethany cox
i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably at the time what stood out for me was the lack of mid movie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don t say the one thing that you re shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this is what i like the most about the movie i guess that the main characters don t do mean things to each other halfway through they don t break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track they re not that different loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone anyway i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again sure there s plot holes if you analyze the script and no woog and dweeb shouldn t be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality now what detracts from the film is it s unexpected scariness little kids under the age of would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr screweyes and the addition of him halfway through the movie though it s blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that it s not that scary without the the dinosaurs i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half considering the target audience who i m sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues i think i ll give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story it s a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every years i think 
its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn t copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids if they like dinosaurs that is i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a but right now is a little late for that yay more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don t want it to be spoiled don t read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any
i wouldn t call we re back a dinosaur s story simply a kiddie version of jurassic park i found it more interesting than that like the former it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices john goodman rhea perlman jay leno walter cronkite julia child kenneth mars yeardley smith martin short and larry king to paraphrase that a given actor the cheers woman the tonight show host the most trusted name in news a famous chef the young frankenstein police chief lisa simpson one of the three amigos and the cnn guy but i guess that i shouldn t focus only on the cast i thought that this movie had something for both children purely fun and adults natural history true it s escapism but the perceptive kind i would actually say that john goodman doing rex s voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in monsters inc worth seeing 
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with s kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaid beauty and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative i m in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child 
this movie has to be my favorite of all time its not supposed to have a plot because its makers wanted people charlie sheen i think to believe it was a real snuff film this was an exercise in visual effects and doesn t cut away when the action happens like every other film does movies these days are now all about sound effects leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood there still are movie makers who still can t get fake blood to look like the real thing there is no rape scene because that wasn t the point of making the film have you seen the hills have eyes the rape scene was funny instead of shocking although i m sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror but since they probably suck at making films they probably wouldn t be able to pull it off the movie baise moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks its too bad that a movie can t be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all especially when talking about an ao or nc rating i m sure eli roth has the ability talent to make his hostel film series much much better but he has too tame it down to get an r rating or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident crime scenes footage don t forget that this movie was made in the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film that would be like someone saying the bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps has better graphics 
this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of the japanese people who star in this must have been really desperate for a job or we re just friends here s the scoop three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her they burn her kick her spin here around in a chair over times they use sound torture by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over hours it don t sound that bad at all but it can make you go nuts they throw guts probably from an animal at her while shes knocked out and she freaks when she wakes up and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen if you have not heard of these films and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film you will think it is just ask charlie sheen this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick like i said pure underground check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gore if your not i highly recommend you read up on the series before watching from the gore shock and creativity aspect it gets a but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a an underground classic my final rating is a 
i first heard of this movie after purchasing the flick snuff i was told that devil s experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peaked devil s experiment is a short film with no story no character development just men torturing a woman for about minutes they torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi pitched noise for hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye i must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes but then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for hours is painful to think about the worst is the eye scene i didn t shutter when watching it but simply thought damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie i did enjoy the flick but i don t know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer 
this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat down from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the case the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate pain sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of fingernails intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one 
i haven t always been a fan but the show grew on me it wasn t until after season that i started to see the richness of the show they finally brought daniel jackson s search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go ould system lords were killed by rival lords sg or others towards season stargate sg was beginning to become stale with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise the show became more and more solid the characters had become stale as well colonel jack o neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o neill s weapon he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go ould ra the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself only allowing his close friends in amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter she was a feminist on the edge ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job though this character had little area to grow tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter s strengths she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal c teal c was an alien called the jaffa infant go ould snake like creatures would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form the jaffa would die teal c was the first prime of apophis army knowing that apophis was not a god like go ould pretend he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy finally having had enough he and jack o neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people after arriving on earth he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for who would help him fight the go ould christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character teal c is a wise warrior much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra tac the show would not be complete without master bra tac played by tony amandola he is also a rock in the end he became adviser to most of sg especially daniel jackson don s davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal he does his job has a wife sons and daughters and grandchildren you can really say he is the anchor of the base simply i would die for that man if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world he will go himself he doesn t leave anyone behind i saved dr daniel jackson for last because this character i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on in choosing shanks i don t think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson they don t talk about spader they talk about shanks in the early years the jackson character came off as a whiner that s why i probably wasn t a fan as the seasons pasted the character became stronger this gave him confidence in the end as of season the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero he still monitors the groups ethics he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward acheaology history culture and exploration are part of his very being he is determined though a man of peace he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement other characters include most recently vala mal doran claudia black and colonel cameron mitchell ben browder new lead of sg both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess i see little difference between mitchell and crichton farscape character black s character is simply off the wall definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon 
guinea pig the devil s experiment is without a doubt stars on first view its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature this movie gets right to the point you may be thinking what point the point is to satisfy fan s of just extreme violence and gore this movie has some gore more or less just torturing a women violently there are really only scene s that could be considered gore i ll tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil s experiment makes hostile look like sesame street if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain t seen the half of it until you ve seen guinea pig the devil s experiment movie rating gore guinea pig the devil s experiment uncut 
i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best even though ive seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those mins of pure torture its that powerful a out of because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do be the best fake snuff film ever made 
after having watched guinea pig two questions come in mind besides am i really a psychopath to watch that is it a snuff the answer is no although it s the closest thing to a snuff movie i ve ever seen and then where the hell have they found that girl because she gets tortured for min without any reasons given in fact there is nothing else in this movie fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots and many more until the final scene i m still not sure how they did that because it belongs to the japonese underground scene it s obvious she didn t get a lot of money so what were her their motivations i saw it in japonese without subtitles but it s not a problem no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes i haven t seen yet all the serial but the first guinea pig is not known for being the best one still i ve rated because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ask charlie sheen the actor but i think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones another movie i m hiding from my parents 
this movie has no story it s only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death spoilers this is what they do they beat her put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood spin her around on a chair until she pukes expose her to loud noise pour boiling oil on her put worms in her sores crush her hand with a sledge hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye this movie was so realistic that if i didn t know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff movie although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it it scared me i guess it fills some kind of purpose i give it a 
i have seen the short movie a few years ago after that i watch all sequels the first one is really not the best but it s the most popular one i ve already watch the making of guinea pig it s really great what these guys did also the sequels are excellent in the special effects take your chance to watch it 
this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best at the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die some scenes are shocking such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched times because you see punches in nearly every movie this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people or older 
the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers her hand smashed with a hammer her eye punctured with a needle and so forth in the most nauseating scene the woman s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to ban its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick re creations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms but gorehounds probably won t find anything special 
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me 
wow alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run unearthed films we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people bash it i m writing this review because i love the guinea pig films why do i love em it s because they go for the throat and they don t let go i ve seen it all almost every horror film known to man argento fulci bava buttgereit from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster i ve seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films why because it doesn t try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the st place this review is for the devils experiment i find it devoid of story which is fine by me why do i watch horror films so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people the devils experiment not only delivers but that s all it is pure unadulterated violence yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold why do people bash it cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story it make em feel better about themselves we all want blood and gore it s just really hard to justify it if it s not wrapped around a story the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released i m thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world maybe i shouldn t have written this review but then again maybe i should my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it s not i ve always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films sure it s exploitive and over the top but isn t that why we watch horror films in the st place the devils experiment is not for everybody it s for thrill seekers and gorehounds only if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you there is a reason why they haven t been released for over years they are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool good luck enjoy and never stop living your life 
a lot of people unfairly sh t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining devil s experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic especially for the video s vintage and low budget let me start at the beginning now for those who don t know this film is an extreme torture fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid s it s plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is this entails brutal violence all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl s arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings the actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes if you haven t seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot for devil s experiment 
my rating refers to the first seasons of stargate sg which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season the show took a different focus still good but different the series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci fi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictable the characters on which the show rests are also well defined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watch starting somewhere around season the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the goa uld then the ori the plots become more complex a lot more political strategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the th and th episodes they are simply can t miss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through seasons if you are a sci fi fan watch a few episodes of the first seasons and you ll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have seasons of shows to look forward to 
the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her she is beaten savagely spun around in the chair endlessly has her finger nails pulled animal guts are thrown at her hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle really sick and nasty scene the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome i have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadistic but less disturbing anyway this one is a must see for horror fans 
first off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one were to look back after the film it really wasn t meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac but really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific in non shock sense it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i didn t trust anyone for about a week because i didn t want to wake up strung up and tortured 
just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion every line every phrase every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con man so well cast out of 
 house of games is a flawlessly constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert s review which proclaimed it the best film of i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the smartest most well written movies i had ever seen the screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that mamet s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it stems naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus mamet s extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the s it is truly a must see 
just watched the film for the rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before it just keeps getting better and better you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in place truly one of the great ones and definitely my all time favourite 
unique movie about confused woman lindsay crouse who gets involved with sharp con men joe mantegna gives an oscar caliber performance as the slickest of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as mantegna shows crouse the ropes of his con games story line unravels a bit later on but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world definitely worth a shot 
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators you re never sure of who is exactly who in this movie this is both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling 
plenty has been written about mamet s the house of games most of it good i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again the film s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us the audience and the mark simultaneously then he explains the art of conning only to do it again etc all the while building the story the house of games now a freebie on cable is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans b 
this typical mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man joe mantegna good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist lindsay crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet s films steven goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didn t become a more noted player than she has become perhaps i m not looking in the right places the movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang up ending you d expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie 
in the spirit of the classic the sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart a prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation while the movie moves kind of slow it s climax and ending are stunning you ll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself 
i enjoyed this show for two reasons richard dean anderson amanda tapping these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors the replacement of rda in seasons was enough to take the heart out of the show the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling this relationship carries over into the program we get to see rda gives his o neill character believable personality he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances still they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous there is a lot going on between carter and o neill under the surface they manage to keep the lid on but often just barely the episode solitudes in season had some of the best drama ever seen on television the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together carter and jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by o neill yet o neill s tactical instincts always seem sound he understands what to do without having to think about the matter the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders the quality declined markedly in seasons and the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show he had his rare moments with claudia black but that was all amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby she was probably thinking more about the child than the show the spin off stargate atlantis has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original the villains wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won t last beyond the fourth season there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci fi the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra modern technology is just as hard to accept i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too in the season opener daniel jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet the episode hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc yet it is never mentioned again this device could have been used in several later episodes on daniel o neill and dr frasier 
a film destined to be on late night tv long after the present instant money makers have long been forgotten perhaps a little too subtle for today s youngsters but in time they ll grow into an appreciation of this movie 
this movie should not be compared to the sting or other caper heist con game films what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships deceit and trust it s also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy highly hugely recommended 
ask yourself where she got the gun remember what she was taught about the mark s mindset when the con is over the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her thousand the patient was in on the con from the beginning mantegna does not die in the end the gun had blanks there enough spoilers for you there this is why people are giving it such high ratings it s extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience 
i m a big fan of films where people get conned and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the films where people get conned genre in short it s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what s happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you ve just seen the film cons the audience on many occasions and despite us knowing this it s still difficult to guess where it s going and every twist comes off as a surprise as mentioned i m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout and david mamet does well in establishing his film s setting in the underground levels of the city the film is well acted also with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film and although his performance is a little under wrought he s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work and again is believable in her role she may not be the greatest looker but at least she can act the way that the film executes it s plot is the main star of the show however and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer at times it s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film another thing that s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons which is useful if you re interested in making twenty bucks say all in all house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride 
spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters but who is conning who here when does the hunter turn into the prey this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are safe it has a riveting script with good acting at least from the leads i didn t notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done right i was very surprised that i liked this movie because i don t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end 
get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time i am relatively unaware of david mamet s writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times it s always a joy to watch i can say without hesitation that he is a genius this film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit con artistry and back room hustles the feel of the film is very similar to the sting and it also pays homage to film noir it s quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch generally the acting is superb especially joe mantegna but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it s not a good idea to have a heroine lindsay crouse who is not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad s hairdo i agree but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role the less you know about the plot of this film the better just like mamet s most recent film the spanish prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance 
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isn t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited 
this is very nearly a perfect film the ideas would be repeated by mamet but never told so succinctly this is really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent is there anyone alive today who hasn t seen this play out in our own society every single day the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller except there are no more innocent characters the world is now completely polluted ruined and everyone is participating in the con could anything be more true don t miss the soundtrack it is wonderful 
 house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that we re dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate so it stands to reason that we never really know what s going on even though we think that we do but that s what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities it has a definite hitchcock slant to it the film draws on some similar themes found his effort marnie considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master s more thought provoking works one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse s character being the same as tippi hedrin s ten year later perhaps both are strong willed loners both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool as crouse s repressed up tight character says what s life without adventure put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks 
wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it s hopeless to help her patients a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better here she gets involved with joe mantegna to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and house of games may very well be the best con movie i ve seen david mamet wrote and directed this gem that s full of snappy dialogue great one liners and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con man and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie the film is in utter control of it s audience and we are loving the con out of 
i m not great at writing reviews so i ll just spout my opinions i loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama i thought it was all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis i loved them all davis it seemed was the fifth most important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and anderson s character colonel o neill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff i don t know whether it s because hammond was more important that i realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn t the original intention a brilliant setup to the series i recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again you ll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv series the last three seasons of the series aren t nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn t mean they aren t good it just means they re a letdown if you ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons after you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series edit on i just found out that don s davis died a few weeks ago it is a great loss 
house of games is spell binding it s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens there are few movies i ve seen that can grip you so quickly from the opening scene this movie just gets you i m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don t read anymore if you don t want to know i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen bar none from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately joe mantegna was also wonderful the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices i also loved the way the movie was filmed in that grainy surreal type of way it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was there were a few movies i ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really house of games is completely different in it s way margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying you know something s going to happen but you have no idea what and just when you think you ve guessed what the something is you realize you haven t even scratched the surface house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it s conclusion in closing i d rank this of call it although not my absolute favorite film pretty high on the list most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists i ve ever seen as well although i love all types and genres of movies when it comes to movies of the human psyche it really doesn t get much better then this see this movie 
here s my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all encompassing con it s like the grifters but without that film s level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouse s lines the way she reads them sound as if they re inner monologue or narration which they aren t with the arrival of mantegna things pick up the dialogue here isn t as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring a ding ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones don t it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words he s far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality what s more strange is that other than this the film doesn t look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowed i wouldn t mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines it s a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn t work that doesn t mean the movie is bad it isn t it s often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middle it s standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is she s a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room i ll admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting she d write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end however and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones the little learner ones to be the most fun we re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is we see the ending coming and then we didn t see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didn t see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling i m going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again james foley did him better 
if your idea of a thriller is car chases explosions and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire then house of games is definitely not the movie for you if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense then by all means see it house of games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer dr margaret ford lindsay crouse who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike joe mantegna to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense frankly i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming just like a clever con artist this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance the story is taut and well crafted the dialogue smart and laconic the acting uniformly good mantegna is superbly charismatic some have complained that dr ford is not a very sympathetic character and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive but dr ford is supposed to be cold and aloof moreover her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point i believe that an injury to her sexual self esteem is a key part of her motivation i ll say no more house of games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity it will hold your attention every second while you are watching and stay with you for a long time afterwards 
house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna and a strong strong cast of supporting players and it introduces ricky jay card sharp extraordinaire prestidigitator and historian of magic its dialogue written by david mamet is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of unrealness on the face of it house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men diametrically different from the sting which was played merely for glamour and yuks at this level it does succeed admirably however you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs house of games sticks to its business as poe once said of a good short story it drives relentlessly to its conclusion there is another strain of movies about women epitomized by thelma and louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths what tripe as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater it should be a natural for film festivals nominate it for one near you if you get the chance i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my year old daughter better she should see it on a tv than not at all 
`the united states of kiss my ass house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller it stars lindsay crouse as best selling psychiatrist margaret ford who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown to visit the lowlife place house of games the gambler mike played excellently by joe mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty he offers crouse s character a deal if she is willing to sit with him at a game a big money game in the backroom he ll cancel the patients debts the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control is it the psychiatrist or the con man or is it the well known man of great bluffs david mamet in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings not the direction in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of mamet s work it is the dialogue which grips you and slowly draws you into the film no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words everyone bluffs and double bluffs which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension house of games can also be viewed as a `class war division movie with lindsay crouse we have the middle class well to do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite the working class of america earning a living by `honest crime the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for it s stunning an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings 
david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `house of games a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game margaret ford lindsay crouse has a successful practice and has written a best selling novel driven still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life there s an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability when a patient billy hahn steven goldstein confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that they re going to kill him if he doesn t pay she decides to intervene on his behalf this takes her to the `house of games a seedy little dive where she meets mike joe mantegna a charismatic con man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world instead of the `twenty five large that billy claimed he owed mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if she ll agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room in the middle of a big hand mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the `tell of one of the other players by this time not only margaret but the audience as well is hooked the dialogue and mamet s unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing as mike leads margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her from that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a `tell is and how it works to the lessons of the `short con to the stunning climax of this film mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless and nothing is what it seems in the end margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself she changes and whether or not it s for the better is open to speculation mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid up tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm self assured exterior and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum joey lilia skala dr littauer j t walsh the businessman ricky jay george and william h macy sergeant moran `house of games is the quintessential mamet he s written and directed a number of high caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future but this film will be the one that defines him and you can go to the dictionary and look it up you ll find it under `perfection this is one great movie you do not want to miss i rate this one 
this movie is amazing while being funny and entertaining it is also profoundly deep and eye opening i will watch it again and again bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life he has a job and a life but it isn t what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness bruce is bitter unsatisfied and resentful that his life isn t the way he envisions it should be as a result of this state of mind bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy with one exception in the process of gaining everything he loses the one person who truly loved him as the movie unfolds bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what was truly there this movie was inspirational and deep if you really pay attention it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize as my wife says since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy and my humble addition may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out 
this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for if you watch t v then you might as well not watch the movie almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny just don t go see this movie expecting to be surprised all in all if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must see otherwise just watch the previews and you ll be just as satisfied 
i absolutely loved this movie it met all expectations and went beyond that i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn t just randomly silly it also had a message jim carrey makes me happy 
wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 
i have to say from the beginning when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of potential though the movie wasn t as erm amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though i m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i don t remember one line from either of those movies i m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you don t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end in though i didn t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn t for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like and i m glad he did other wise i wouldn t have seen the brilliant shows like sg which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isn t better or as good as sg its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you don t watch this then you have no idea what you are missing 
bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box office disappointments it s great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths he won t get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film it s like the return of an old friend carrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey s nemesis carrell of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up in arms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television selling prayers to god and again about of the country will care and of the media will report it the bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do and a feel good feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry thanks again jim it s great to have you back 
after a slow beginning bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say it wasn t one of jim carrey s best performances but he was still ok morgan freeman was just right as god jennifer aniston had some good moments i miss steve correll on the daily show i like director tom shadyac s choices of movies he also did liar liar patch adams and the nutty professor in all three of those and in bruce almighty he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him a director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people that s too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity my grade out of 
let me start out by saying i m a big carrey fan although i ll admit i haven t seen all of his movies cough the magestic cough bruce almighty was enjoyable none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end i dont know what the writers were thinking somehow i couldn t help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re creating liar liar on a positive note the daily show s steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast see bruce almighty if you re a big jim carrey fan or if you just want to see a light hearted que soft piano music somewhat funny comedy 
`bruce almighty will sweep the academy awards with a record oscar wins it will surpass `titanic as the highest grossing film of all time jim carrey s illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the white house playoffs almighty then these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers carrey included would possess the powers of god that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey s new laugh riot `bruce almighty carrey plays bruce nolan a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps god heavenly played by morgan freeman grants bruce the `gift of god his powers in order to challenge him if he can do god s job any better obviously bruce gets `carreyed away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `bruce almighty jennifer aniston was not `mis pittiful as bruce s girlfriend however my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time `bruce almighty is not the most in depth carrey film but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `carreyism good
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this season late may and a good improvement on carrey s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments elements of jim s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy drama bruce almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good natured taste eight out of ten stars 
ok so it s not a masterpiece like the godfather but it doesn t have to be the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times it has accomplished its purpose i laughed out loud and left with a smile i feel like i got my money s worth 
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching grade b
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the wife all in all note i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out 
i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn t the goal his character is like all of us wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself i thought jennifer aniston s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry s basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that s the way it was written i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart a funny film 
i am a very big jim carrey fan i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura i also like him in his serious movies especially truman show this one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side he is of course very funny in this movie but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with a lot of ease he is truely a multi function actor as for the rest of the cast i was happy with jennifer aniston s acting i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass morgan freeman makes a very cool god as for steven carell his limited scenes are very funny especially in the anchor scene overall i would have to rate this a good acting funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good film 
i would have rated the series a perfect for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season the final episode of the th season unending where it would certainly appear that the asgard have been killed off in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief from the extremely rushed end of the series it s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg franchise for the two upcoming direct to dvd moves unless the asgard return in a future sg movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean up of loose ends poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci fi series 
i first heard about this film about years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i don t remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it about or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasn t was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organic looking film not that that s a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including hand tinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the film s scenes filmed off of a video monitor giving it a more distressed lo res look don t get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite ground breaking for that s why it s still one of my favorite short experimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well 
a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see 
bruce almighty one of carrey s best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is messing up the anchor man s voice my rating 
this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film he was both funny and sad carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan nolan blames god morgan freeman for everything that goes wrong in his life then god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers as i said before carrey did an excellent job i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor actress the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point this movie can be funny bruce s dog as well as sad the break up the script worked well too i am glad they made a sequel to this film i rate this film a 
bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan an average man who feels god is messing up his life god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways of course giving someone god s powers could take a turn for the worse bruce almighty is a good comedy jim carrey is good as always morgan freeman is first rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well the jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey s facial expressions i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as a black man i thought this quite well especially with the brilliant freeman there are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still a good film out of 
 bruce almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers nevertheless i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more bruce jim carrey is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god and though it isn t his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers reactions to him as well as freeman s seemingly laid back and wisecracking image of god it is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny there is a decent supporting cast such as jennifer aniston lisa ann walter and steve carrell which always helps the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear jerking and the message is clear that we should do what god has called us to do and be the miracle the film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than i and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the film out of 
if you want a serious laugh pain watch this movie and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster the deleted scenes are priceless i don t know why they didn t include them in the original movie it can t be because of time since the movie is only minutes long morgan freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long jim carrey needs meds 
as someone who lives near buffalo new york this movie scored points with me before i even saw it since the story is based here there are even some bit parts with real life news tv anchor people from buffalo and for once it doesn t knock the area hallelujah theology wise puh leeze god is still made to look and think like humans and of course be a bit on the liberal side being the lightweight comedy it is it s nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill minutes there are some laugh out loud slapstick comedy scenes and hopefully audiences from christians to atheists got something out of this besides a few laughs such as what prayer should really be all about kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message overall it s a good hearted film that should offend very few 
i really do not know what people have against this film but it s definitely one of my favourites it s not preachy it s not anchored by it s moral it shouldn t be controversial it s just god any possible god no matter the religion and it s really funny jim carry plays bruce nolan a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less to himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace jennifer aniston away when the final straws are executed he s quick to not laugh but yell in the face of god who in turn gives bruce his powers bruce then makes his life better for himself until he s guilted into helping others where he then continues to miss the point of his powers meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish leaving his relationship on dangerous ground ok that was kinda long but as a plot it works well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together and is able to hide itself fairly well as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place carrey s pitch perfect acting stays in character which luckily enough is him and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour is half execution and the humour is very good in the first place but without carrey it would kinda feel like a it s a wonderful life wannabe jennifer aniston is great and no matter what some may say does not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you don t think that when you see her she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you re watching a movie she and carrey feel very much like a real couple the movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand has a very nice feeling tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey s career which wasn t goin anywhere 
well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don t consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman s best 
now either you like mr carrey s humour or you don t me myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and on the other hand cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream but you have been warned if you re not sure watch the trailer i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film if you don t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny don t bother with the movie carrey a reporter stuck in a rut covering lighter news berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better carrey gets into the swing of having all of god s powers by making his girlfriend jennifer aniston s breasts bigger getting himself promoted and answering everyone s prayers by single stroke computer commands this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable but it is very well made within it s very limited intent provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow minded god squadders and anti god squadders on the more thoughtful level the film tempts us to speculate about carrey s own career stuck in his comedy typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes his most accomplished straight role the man on the moon is less well known that his comedy romps or the truman show on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey 
i nominate this and babylon as the best television sci fi series made both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters if you look at the original star trek and star trek tng they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes in many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring this was less the case with deep space with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other trek shows as there was more of a larger story that unified them this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon and saw this to an even greater extent with sg the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny and speaking of funny i loved that sg kept the mood light from time to time and wasn t so dreadfully serious in this way i actually enjoyed it more than babylon jack o neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson it s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons to truly appreciate sg you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power and if you don t like sg after giving it a fair chance then sci fi is probably not the genre for you 
starring jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a conceptual nightmare jim carrey playing god nothing is sacred anymore well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent yes jim carrey has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i ll give you the low down jim carrey plays bruce nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life he lives with his beautiful girlfriend grace anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground then bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter obviously not please bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired much complaining and griping about god later bruce gets a page after a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the omni presents building heh there he meets god freeman who is the boss electrician and janitor of the building i found this highly amusing god is the boss the holy spirit is the electrician and jesus christ is the janitor think about it boss obvious electrician the guy who keeps everything running janitor the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left brilliant anyway bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god he starts to believe a bit wonder why enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies since this is hollywood bruce obviously eventually smartens up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done not bruce s since it is jim carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it the movie is not perfect theology but for hollywood it is definitely a good attempt many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it bottom line out of worth a view or two 
jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires in that case it wasn t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn t be ignored i m reminded of the episode of michael moore s brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so it s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that s seeking to bake the world s biggest cookie he s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer s religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i don t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film it s amazing how far he s come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the side splitting office space as bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some low brow comedy in the film that doesn t really fit with the importance of the film s meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura s friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows it s always nice to see familiar characters it s almost like seeing family again bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even more the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruce s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery s cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed mother in law bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy it s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching don t miss this one 
as long as you go into this movie knowing that it s terrible bad acting bad effects bad story bad everything then you ll love it this is one of my favorite goof on movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs 
china o brien was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he s lost his touch because he s not that great of a director the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms rothrock and richard norton if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight to video action flick china o brien returns home to help out her dad he s having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help so she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies if you re a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie s catered for you i only enjoyed the fighting scenes everything else is rubbish why didn t raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director recommended 
this one and her pilgrim soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series there s something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned it s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling s version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite i remember i wasn t surprised by the korean movie il mare later remade into the lake house i think it s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film 
this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves huge tv looking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age and the examination day a point where year olds must undergo a government required iq test the kid is this story dickie jordan david mendenhall is just celebrating his own th birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades his parents christopher allport and elizabeth norment on the other hand say he shouldn t have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe he s capable and he should have no need to worry it s pretty obvious they are worried i won t give anything away in the ending but i will say this there s a point where we get a glimpse of what s to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask dickie whether he d prefer to watch tv all night by today s standards we d be pleased he d say he d rather read and not just because there s nothing worth watching but why would his family ask this the flavor of what s encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon which i hear hasn t received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they could ve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i haven t read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting a year ld boy peter robert duncan mcneill is suffering a fever from unclean water that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne kerry noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since it s common for that to happen in but the connection doesn t go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of and they each enjoy each other s company especially peter who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college he s been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lesson warning that sounds like something rod sterling would ve cooked up and entertainment make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling s crew 
remember these two stories fondly and in the first set in the not too distant future we see a young boy preparing for examination day the state i q test the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth the boy then asks puzzled again why wouldn t he it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry but their son s i q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial a corker of a concluding scene a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion 
you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies even the really bad ones why to see their heroes in action one more time that s the way i feel about doc savage i am a major fanatic for the character and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming and the first minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie resulting in a somewhat disjointed film there s a lot of promise in here diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music the camp elements etc but the spirit of doc is there and that s what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to so in my long winded way what i m trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it s just not as good as it should have been and anyone who is a fan of superman james bond indiana jones buckaroo banzai and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all 
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball likewise an occasional excursion of or hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyone s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world s events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviously the newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visual narrative method of story telling the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough s tarzan and johnston mcculley s zorro the s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g s battle aces and the spider master of men all found their way to the news stands among many others one other was doc savage a full blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super hero he also assembled of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologist archaeologist paleontologist etc the doc savage stories were very popular in the s and s and were published into the middle s then they went into a hiatus for a good years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirt the re introduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over years before any real project got put together it was veteran stop action animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothers when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tv ron ely s nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this case the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of doc s with a miniature rocket missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pal s being the producer his last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci fi action setting of the pulp character s world i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our nd child michelle our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre rd kedzie here in chicago having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this camp business but would not have objected if mr pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp comic serial type excitement and yet the cast headed up by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone and maybe that s just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of bronze 
having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with certainty is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass let s be honest here this film is just so much fun ok so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character s but let s put this into a clear perspective do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic s batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but that s precisely its charm former tarzan ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke lemonade and milk at a formal occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen priceless simply put the film doesn t take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and you ll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed 
this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention such as how was the stargate activated without a human computer where did the goa uld ra s race come from how many are there the first episode has a retired jack o neill spelled with ls recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis a powerful goa uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman we meet samantha carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time and is determined to go through now we find out that daniel got married on abydos and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial then daniel s wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams in which jack s team will be sg which consists of jack samantha and daniel they go to chulak a goa uld homeworld to rescue daniel s wife and another one captured at abydos named ska ra they get captured and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a jaffa named teal c first prime of apophis saves them and goes to earth with them where he is made part of sg that was only the beginning of the adventure in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities swapped bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa uld called the tok ra in which samantha s dad becomes a member the asgard a cute little race in which we see thor most often he s jack s buddy and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times the show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons in season nine a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators the ancients season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ben browder as cameron mitchell the new leader of sg and claudia black as vala maldoran a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team very well produced interesting characters fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack this one has it all a different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you don t want to miss unlock the gate and step through you won t regret it 
 possible spoilers i recently watched this movie with my year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron ely is just right as doc cool calm almost always in control and with an occasional twinkle in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i don t know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring do many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark which i don t think is fair the difference in budget is astounding raiders must have at least times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the sousa music is catchy love that theme song every time i watch the film i end up humming the theme for days the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it out of doc savage doc savage thank the lord he s here 
most people miss hollywood s point of concept if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then i approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage in all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to decorate the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as doc savage james bond superman batman spiderman and others doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the best of the best before james bond superman or any of the others all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character not the man of bronze 
the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the s created concept that comic books could only be done as camp i e the s batman show for tv and movie thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on a cluelessly unromantic doc savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps not an idiot monk mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute and when they re not doing booming sousa march scores the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the drama even as such this movie is okay it s fun and when it stays serious it s a very accurate representation of the pulps except for monk as has been mentioned before he s hugely muscled not obese and long tom who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude not paul gleason with an inexplicable scarf the green death sequences for instance are remarkably gruesome and not something i d recommend for children but they are very close to the feel of the pulps when the writers and producers get it right they do get it right i ll give them that but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of say reeves first two superman movies think what we might have had then i think the problem is the movie s schizophrenic there s a definite sense of trying to do a s homage but they re also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that batman created one gets the impression there was a sober pulp style first draft and then someone came in and said hey let s make it funny it worked with the batman show years ago but doc lives on thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai if macrauch ain t doing a homage to doc savage in that movie the man is truly demented so when the series actually gets on tv allegedly mid season in doc savage updated to the s will live once more 
this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that way it is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous the so called green death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film hey lighten up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy seas is dealt with i promise you that if you don t try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend minutes in a most enjoyable manner 
outragously entertaining period piece set in the s it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series as much as raiders of the lost ark only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau predating batman by two decades starring ron ely tarzan as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non existent latin american country of hidalgo best line our hero to mona holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug mona you re a brick paul wexler s ham and cheese blackhat captain seas is a an absolute delight expect a little raiders a dash of batman a little the lost world a little lost horizons and a whole lot of campiness and you ll get it just right watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa s patriotic music a prime candidate for dvd release it is certainly overdue an unmissable treat for the whole family 
i was brought up on doc savage and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i m odd but there you are i don t know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it s time it is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron ely is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn t been released on dvd in the uk i don t think it should be remade and bastardised like i said it s a classic it cannot be done without ron like the italian job without mini s and michael caine i give it 
we so often talk of cinema landmarks kane the godfather a bout de souffle one film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics i am talking of course about the classic doc savage m o b this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism not to mention kung fu it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course queen s breathtaking work on flash gordon although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search ten fold 
given the title this first follow up to quartet obviously reduces the number of w somerset maugham stories which comprise the film the author still turns up to introduce the episodes but there s no epilogue this time around by the way while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r c sheriff here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation as well as noel langley though it s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison as can be expected much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment though this also extends to at least three cast members namely naunton wayne wilfrid hyde white and felix aylmer the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled the colonel s lady while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running time it s still done with the utmost care acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain the verger tells of a church sexton james hayter for which the story s title is another word who s dismissed after years of service by the new parish priest michael hordern simply because he s illiterate rather than rest on his laurels despite his age he not only takes a wife his landlady played by kathleen harrison but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered and with business flourishing this is developed into a whole chain the last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who not only is surprised to learn of hayter s lack of education but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were to which the wealthy and respected tobacconist replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a verger the second episode mr know all is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man nigel patrick british despite his foreign sounding name of kelada who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick s attentions to his pretty wife anne crawford during a fancy dress party however the passengers decide to enact their revenge on kelada by having one of them impersonate him a jest which he naturally doesn t appreciate still it s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character told by crawford that the necklace she s wearing is an imitation wayne challenges patrick to name its price but the latter realizes immediately that it s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford s position if he were to tell so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer as can also be deduced from the title sanatorium deals with the myriad patients at such a place run by andre morell the protagonist is a new intern roland culver who wistfully observes the various goings on the narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate strands of plot one humorous the feud between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium played by finlay currie and john laurie one melodramatic the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies and one bittersweet the romance between na ve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a lifer while rennie only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the altar 
the makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it whether the period is the s the first story the present ie for the middle story or the s the last costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls roland culver as ashenden is very appealing but never mind the soppy young lovers it s raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife s health and independence who harrows our emotions he usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive the china seas great s film starring gable and harlow stole the plot from the mr know all episode and also nicked a story by kipling i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat i love that posh bird who plays his wife too 
trio s vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch observation in film it isn t necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile small morality storytelling is quaint or coy only in the eye of the beholder thankfully story content well told can overcome it s time subject or place ironically there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era inserting small morality content occasionally might provide a dimension lacking 
a message movie but a rather good one outstanding cast top to bottom interesting in that bette davis s plot line is essentially back story the extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplay playwright associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about angles in america etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me theatrical and movie making and acting styles vary over time and of course years later this particular movie would not be made in this way yes casablanca is a better movie i guess but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them casablanca is primarily a love story the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot more of a thriller both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
this is actually a trilogy of of somerset maugham s short tales the first one is the verger which is about minutes long and very enjoyable after years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can t read nor write so what does he do opens a tobacco shop of course the second is mr know all which was actually a story i had read for school years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another minute one and also very good it worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps that s because i was only the last time afterall the rd one is nearly a let down almost an hour in length it simply drags it s not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i hadn t missed a thing overall i give them and out of respectively 
made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i ll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ship s entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i won t describe the way max rises to the occasion sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock s the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching 
wilhelm grimm alexander knox stands trial for nazi crimes three witnesses give evidence father warecki henry travers wilhelm s brother karl erik rolf and wilhelm s former lover marja marsha hunt before wilhelm speaks in his own defense the film ends after the court sums up the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna shirley mills who wilhelm is accused of raping the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps and the church service where willie grimm richard crane denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina dorothy morris marja s daughter after she has been shot at a brothel throughout the film knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter resentful and evil man martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished 
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late and into would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities the film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in the war ended in may in this fictitious world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm s life since in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama all in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors there are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can t help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall it s a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film fyi this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper this is in fact not true previously he d been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper hanger 
never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates alexander knox wilhelm gimm gorky park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind marsha hunt marja pacierkowski chloe s prayer played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people s families and their entire lives the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers if you have not seen this film and like this subject matter give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a film and a story you will not forget too quickly 
the only reason i give this movie an out of is because there are few movies in my opinion that are perfect this little b picture is a taut story well told i ve always been intrigued by alexander knox but have seen him very few movies here he plays wilhelm grimm a sad little man who turns into a monster he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse the performance is one of the most chilling performances i ve ever seen since world war actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars i imagine that since this was made during the war the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil but knox puts in that kind of performance a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer i still can t get over it marsha hunt who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly is cast against type in probably the best performance i ve ever seen her give too maybe not oscar worthy but the best of her career nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama if you like human drama stories or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis i highly recommend this fine little film 
this one is tough to watch as an earlier reviewer says that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii particularly the liberation of dachau it is clear that as of the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the jews the sequence that shows a transport is vivid almost as if based upon an actual newsreel the nazis liked to record their atrocities knox as the nazi is brilliant he charts the course of a nazi career that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans at first laughing at hitler then incredulous and finally helpless that contrast however permits us to believe in the conversion of one young nazi officer to an anti nazi stance that did happen as witness the several attempts against hitler most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out a strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended 
this movie was extremely funny i would like to own this for my vintage collection of s movie must see again list i know this cast of characters they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs redd foxx always a clown of comedy pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out dennis dugan crazy funny man miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience love lust strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer episode from seinfeld the parents have there jaw dropping moment fun over fun it is screaming bring me back 
norman is that you was this is all third hand so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an african american family from a jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen also it was one of those movies originally filmed in video so the prints from the theater can t have been that great still performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family for that reason alone it s pretty interesting if not a little hollywood don t believe me check out lines about curtains etc very stereotypical not too deep but the movie really shines in a couple of areas there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife who s run away with his brother to ensenada in a souped up pinto the phone conversation across the border is really memorable but the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs to the best of my knowledge this is the only time that routine was filmed and it s a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version i m told still it s vintage madame and shouldn t be missed people are still stealing lines from wayland the man was truly gifted enjoy the movie 
i saw a trailer for this on afro promo the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african americans it looked like what it is a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay it would seem that redd foxx s rf wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in phoenix he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles so as rf arrives norman wearing nothing but powder blue bikini shorts gets out of his waterbed to answer the door trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the th floor norman tries to wake his lover who steadfastly refuses to budge it was just to the point where i wrote why won t he wake up when suddenly he does and me and my friend s jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue eyed swirl hairdoed garson norman s white live in lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from l a he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father s visit garson goes to stay with waylon flowers and madam answers the phone when norman calls so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico while he is on the phone garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him with a burst of s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we re about to hear a very special track by the emotions he realizes that his son is gay his first impulse is i ll kill him i ll kill him then rf goes on a long walk wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man surprisingly he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality this it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all rf then hires audrey a six foot amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night he commiserates over the loss of rf s wife and tells the tale of his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because she was molested at a luau they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose once more mouths were agape so it seems that wouldn t ya just know it rf and garson have a wonderful evening together you see staid traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highly effeminate entertainment of mega queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer it s really just that simple this still does not prevent rf from yelling rape when garson wakes him from a bad dream it ends less predictably than you d think there was so much that was just off what is the basis of norman and garson s relationship they don t seem to have any rapport and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never defends garson or talks about their relationship there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality and sitting right down on the park bench to read them i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends other than that it s kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance we could all learn to love and understand one another and because of the whole naivet of this thing the extreme stereotypes and message laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past years i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by extension convert them hey check out cinema de merde my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in you can find the url in my email address above 
say what you will about schmaltz one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose to me the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly bette davis mother and brother as fanny says we ve been shaken out of the magnolias in today s political climate where led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings we sunk to the level of the murderers to seek blood thirsty vengeance it can t all be blamed on mr bush after all we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed now with complete justification we americans are reviled throughout the world today we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character but a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts i m not comparing george bush to adolph hitler but i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror hatred and hyper nationalism to do despicable things sadly the blackmailer who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement no matter how immoral is most like the leaders of our country those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can t even be bothered to vote a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be a force for the betterment of humanity and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals geoff
even though this movie came out a year before i was born it is definetely one of my favorite comedies it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son s homosexuality like most parents he doesn t know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like his son norman is now grown up and living on his own when his father ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie when ben gets to norman s apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it s his son in drag norman is that you the movie had me laughing from start to finish redd foxx is great although a lot of the content is stereotypical i didn t find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending highly recommended 
a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid s this film was a huge hit for about minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish high anxiety the cheap detective the black bird don t look now we re being shot at and have no profile at all today norman was the comedy of the month in whenever and everyone seemed to see it laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film an experiment at the time norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong just as it should be in fact as a groovy film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today 
melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which this time he inhabits the role of a detective who can t place love before duty and adventure and the warmly beautiful joan blondell who far from being illiterate as one reviewer suggested wrote a novel about her early life is as enjoyable as ever as his ever suffering sweetheart it s almost a screwball comedy almost a thin man type movie almost a series i guess that didn t quite make it to a sequel it doesn t quite reach classic status but it has all the ingredients for a fun minutes with an episodic but pacey script fine character actors and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don t notice that williams douglas isn t exactly columbo when it comes to detecting i wish there were more films like this 
the amazing mr williams stars melvyn douglas who did five films in one of which was ninotchka with garbo his co star was joan blondell maxine who also did five films that year three of which they made together douglas is lt williams and he and his co horts are presented with a dead body and they must figure out what really happened viewers will recognize his co workers the actors clarence kolb donald macbride don beddoe always played positions of authority senators bank presidents policemen this who dunnit has a flair of comedy to it the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other and even williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally some fun gags williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend there s a lot of fun stuff in here so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on don t want to give away any spoilers so you ll have to catch it on turner classic movies director alexander hall made mostly comedies and was reportedly engaged to lucy at some point 
melvyn douglas and joan blondell co star in the amazing mr williams a mystery comedy that s quite good although forgotten probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed what happens in this film is no exception he s called to a murder scene just as he s about to walk down the aisle yet again both stars were excellent at comedy worked together well and often and help make this battle of the sexes fun edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support as you can read in other reviews melvyn douglas doesn t make much of a woman entertaining if a little on the long side one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas one of our greatest actors he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man he wasn t lazy but rather a very hard working actor who made it look easy who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career he just wasn t cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in hud and i never sang for my father and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk 
the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i don t know much about it s unfortunate when there aren t many comments for a certain tile because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast you don t get an idea of what to expect i read the review before watching this title and i don t know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the greatest i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable it isn t one of the great all time classics but a pleasant and funny diversion much more than you can hope for in most newer movies if you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed 
what was there about that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films well whatever it was the magic may also be found in this columbia picture it s a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show maltin s movie book does not contain it in nearly every department amazing mr williams is a jewel it s the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended as the wedding bells are about to ring he gets called to the scene of a murder the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force there are a lot of laughs in the process melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious the film goes on a bit too long but who cares the screwball comedies are always able to entertain and this film belongs right in there with the best 
delightful minor film juggling comedy and detective romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams melvyn douglas balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll joan blondell and his duty to the force as an ace detective this hodge podge may not appeal to all viewers today but in its day it had something to offer every member of the movie going family and the resolution to the rather tired feeling versus duty plot is original and refreshing and well worth the wait the amazing mr williams contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history and its bright comic repartee sparkles ludicrously frocked melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines i d walk down main street in a turkish towel before i d let any woman control my life and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb good grief you look like my aunt nellie the crime solving here is standard fare although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life from today s vantage point the amazing mr williams is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes at times it is both subtle and penetrating playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene 
this movie is very good the screenplay is enchanting but meryl streep is most impressive her performance is excellent she brings me to go into the heart of her role 
this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all generally speaking i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories and this one is great besides meryl s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise the movie s greatest asset is the story it is based on the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions the other face of the so called civilized society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say this is very general even though this specific tale unfolds in australia that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought provoking 
i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family he s a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and long suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop running the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn t ring true it sounded more like anti fascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoying particularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent it s really tough to believe that the ultra famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesn t sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is good but the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments but that s really about all 
i believe they were telling the truth the whole time u cant trust anything in the wild they family went through hell those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them but still having to deal with the rumours as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister i cant believe this case went on for so long seems like the jury couldn t see the truth even if it bit them on the ass i feel for this family and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them i would i have no idea what they went through i cant even imagine it after watching this movie i was in tears and had to check on my little girl in bed i think everyone should watch this 
when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock australia lindy chamberlain meryl streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press and the whole thing turns into a circus lindy doesn t help matters either because she won t play to the jury or courtroom she s only herself and she s a tough nut to crack so of course everyone thinks she s guilty because there s a piece of evidence that hasn t come to light sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain a seventh day adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife it s good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too because the australian public doesn t believe the story and the media only fans the flames eventually lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor but years later a missing piece of evidence shows up and she s freed but not until after the family s life is basically ruined a heart breaking story very well done a bit long but well worth seeing out of 
religious bigotry is rampant everywhere australia is not immune to it a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby i don t mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting knee deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison buy or rent the movie and discover how deep seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors both meryl streep with her famous aussie accent and sam neill whose accent is his native born pronunciation are outstanding those with supporting roles are also quite good you will remember this movie for many years see it 
this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial it was not granted to lindy chamberlain accused of killing her baby the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely a dingo was alleged to have taken it but those implying her guilt even more so and there was no solid evidence against her but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media and the media themselves of course were anything but innocent in this process so although cleared by an initial inquest they were later prosecuted and convicted although chamberlain was eventually released this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence proving their innocence something no defendants should have to produce a cry in the dark is well acted throughout especially by meryl streep who puts on a convincing australian accent at least to this pom s ears and manages keep lindy sympathetic to us while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking because we believe in the characters as real regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story something i can t comment on the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership s least charitable instincts no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away i m not a religious man but the bible still contains some killer lines if you ll excuse the pun judge not lest ye be judged is one of them 
a cry in the dark a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid if unremarkable film this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep s best actress nomination the movie received little attention from major awards groups little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama well constructed on every level if you ask me this is an under appreciatted classic the film opens rather slowly letting the audience settle into the chamberlain s at a relaxed pace and really notice that at the core they are an incredibly loving simple family fred schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy streep and michael sam neill chamberlain care for their children while the famous line a dingo took my baby has become somewhat of a punchline these days the movie never even comes close to laughable the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured it is subtle and realistic leaving the audience horrified and asking questions the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects lindy of murder the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping as an audience member i was fully invested in the chamberlain s plight and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media but at the same the media public opinion is understandable i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic but they always had valid reasons to hold their views the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas in terms of performances the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill and they deliver in every way for me this ranks as one of if not meryl streep s best performances for all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters i find this to be one of streep s more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park and neill an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park is a perfect counterpoint to streep s performance from what i ve seen this is undoubtedly neill s finest work to date it s a shame he wasn t recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep s b c the two of them play of each other brilliantly more emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams the dingo took my baby watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line a 
fascinating movie based on a true story about an australian woman lindy chamberlain meryl streep accused of killing her baby daughter she insists that a dingo took her baby but the story is highly suspicious the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman s conviction based on barely any hard evidence i love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system i ve always thought that juries ought to be showed angry men before they go through with their duties it s not as has often been said a liberal movie but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge a cry in the dark is likewise clinical schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic some may find the film boring or dry but i found it engaging 
in august the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock central australia that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area no one believed them lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael as an accessory after the fact the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing the chamberlain s trial was over before it began lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty there was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure how could we as a nation even sit in judgement from where we are how could we possibly presume to know unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the chamberlains should have been acquitted fred schepisi s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson s novel that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation hell bent on the truth being brought to light he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay his screenplay co written with robert caswell vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight even her accent is almost but not quite spot on a very good effort by the master of that trade sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his christianity his as was streep s is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly the entire support cast are also excellent with some of australia s finest actors and actresses playing a part technically the film is brilliant too with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the rock editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while bruce smeaton provides a telling score for all aussies this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known as michael chamberlain said i don t think anybody really understands what innocence means to innocent people saturday may video even on return viewings fred schepisi s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson s novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact what followed was little more than trial by media and with the australian people determined she be put away lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence she is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent though she does her level best to sound ocker you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn t cast in the role but star power is probably the answer alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels powerless to do anything about it a strong aussie cast lend compelling support editing from jill bilcock is very timely ian baker s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton s music is perfect for the part truly a must for all conscientious australians sunday june video
i found it hard to like anyone in this film the central characters lindy and michael chamberlain whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback are not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life s tragic disarray the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip news media crowds mobs and assumptions it s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it s merely an account of a true story that happened there society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one s own unaware perceptions influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one s life the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out from the victims to the masses the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside suspicion was jet fueled mostly by a virtue of hers to the public eye she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter why was she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up for tv and the press how much of the downward spiral could ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public s liking in the media meryl streep one of if not the greatest actress working today may not give a performance that particularly stands out and frankly neither does any other actor or department of film making but she and the screenwriters do understand lindy what is infuriating is that it s not that difficult apparently she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie s choice the devil wears prada angels in america or other such work it is a triumph it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself she frustrates us because we don t know what she s thinking or feeling it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her but this is the movie s way of suggesting the reaction of the public s attention she is married to a pastor and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most initially they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god s will kick starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part whatever happened to the little girl her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media s intake didn t immediately identify so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry well meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen but the australian public plays the real leads here like punctuation for each plot advance director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections this golan globus docudrama is not particularly memorable the setting s atmosphere doesn t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public 
i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself the cast just makes it that much more appealing meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture she nails mrs chamberlain s mannerisms the accent and even look she shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that lindy had to endure and in the process it s hard to remember that it isn t lindy in my opinion this performance of meryl s was better than her oscar winning turn in sophie s choice and should have garnered her her third oscar sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasn t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination in all this movie only receive one oscar nod streep s for best actress however it did receive several australian oscars and nominations definitely a top rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast 
meryl streep is such a genius well at least as an actress i know she s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just makes streep s work all the more remarkable i think she is worth all or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were a couple of interesting things i don t know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues a pretty good film a bit different grade b
this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor i don t see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor i just don t think she did a very good job bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie they are going by train to davis s relatives house davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest but when they arrive home their is a nazi living there and their s not much either can do about it it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself 
this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it s impact on australian society it especially looks at the problem of innuendo gossip and expectation when dealing with real life dramas one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings it s an issue that has to be constantly addressed the leads play the characters with depth personality and sensitivity and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based on fact individuals some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors it re enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals spoiler warning i have to say something very personal here in that i am actually an ex adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers it captured the themes of the story brilliantly i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to play the best case for their character they could while this is especially apt for this story i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well 
once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended you ll find that it s not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent neill and streep are both impeccable it s also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who don t come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they don t really go beyond the standard stuff this movie s story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such 
meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense based on the book evil angels and titled so in its australian release a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch it presents a scenario that s all too real for us in america the witch hunt against a person deemed an easy target lindy chamberlain was this woman being someone who spoke her mind someone who didn t play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn t kill her own child the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece and through it all lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband michael was falling apart this stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank people don t understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty because of her sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair someone has to or the chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news media they ll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public 
spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain s guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray the actelone plates dr james cameron s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn t apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a layman to understand to this point beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn t believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony finding azaria s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book shook me for that reason and i ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone s guilt ever since excepting oj of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don t think it could have been done better i ve always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it s not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn t receive more publicity at the time it was released 
lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam neill have just welcomed a baby girl azaria as seventh day adventists they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church with their two older boys looking on michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer s rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia not being wealthy the family camps near the site after a wonderful first day lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents suddenly she hears azaria crying as lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head the baby is gone and soon so is the dingo although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child the chamberlains struggle to accept god s decision and go on with their lives but unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby she is subsequently arrested and put on trial how could this happen this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination the entire country turns against the chamberlains in part because they are seen as odd streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy whose own strong willed demeanor works against her every step of the way neill likewise does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael the cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy s case the costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line if you have never seen or heard of this film remedy that straight away it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media 
this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears meryl streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn t particularly likable the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the s these real life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating why isn t sam sheppard in jail the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and sheppard was tried and convicted only after years in jail was he exonerated i love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process this is one of those movies other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include hurricane the thin blue line and breaker morant in particular the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended 
an unqualified the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old hollywood sam neill and meryl streep are very good together neill matches streep line for line and take for take it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best notwithstanding the intensity of his role this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms the movie which won several top awards in australia boasts not only a superlative cast and director but wonderful and authentic australian locales it proves that people are the same the world over and after all these years people still delight in repeating the famous streep line accent and all a dingo ate moy baby including that imp elaine benis on seinfeld 
when i first saw a cry in the dark i had no idea what the plot was but when i saw it i was shocked at what it portrayed when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class i realized a second point communication issues you see when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain s meryl streep baby she and her husband michael sam neill were grief stricken but didn t show it as seventh day adventists they believed that god willed this to happen and so they couldn t mourn it but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness everyone started believing that lindy did it herself the point is the wrong message got communicated to the public and it turned people against lindy even though this was a pure accident it still happened it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media regardless of any media outlet s political views as for the performances streep does a very good job with an australian accent no surprise there and sam neill is equally great you will probably get blown away just by what you see here definitely one of fred schepisi s best movies ever 
meryl streep was incredible in this film she has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted she was played realistically too she got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt i didn t expect much from the film initially but i really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events it turned out to be better than i had anticipated sam neill was also outstanding this is the best work i ve seen from him and i ve really liked him in other movies the piano for example i gave the film a but if i could rate just the acting i d give the it a and a perfect for streep 
 a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy chamberland who in witnessed a horrific sight seeing her month old baby being brutally taken from their family s tent while camping on the austrailian outback azaria the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired 
watch on the rhine is one of the best anti nazi propaganda films made during world war two paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was i would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great ms bette davis 
some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them as i watched this film made in in i thought i was watching the o j simpson debacle although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation the australian news media if this movie is to be believed devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought it was scary to see the scenes of invasive swarming media hordes ridiculous accounts of half truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society equally appalling is the media s depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case the accused are seven day adventists today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important streep is excellent as usual and this is the best i ve ever seen sam neill the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible 
this is an extremely powerful based on a true story film that can be infuriating to watch i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good let s just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts without giving anything away all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally 
roll is a wonderful little film toby malone plays an year old kid very well acted by the way who is into soccer malone s cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags a drug lord some tough bikers some cops and some prostitutes and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law what the contents of either gym bag is and even what gender a key biker is parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels for me roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll those opinions are i really want to visit australia one day the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation some of the best filmmakers in the are australian the cinematography in roll was especially impressive i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes australian women are hot 
mat spirogolou s toby malone family know he is a talented footballer and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him but the cousins are like chalk and cheese one a naive farm boy the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day having missed his cousin george damien robertson on arrival in the city mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one toby malone probably better known for his work in theatre puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager there are telltale signs of a low budget but as with so many other low budget movies there s more fun seemingly more spontaneity and more charm than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster 
i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced mins of roll roll is about a country boy mat toby malone who has dreams of becoming a sports star mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george damien robertson well that was the plan anyway george is involved with a gangster tiny john batchelor and is making a delivery for him needless to say mat gets dragged into george s world i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job every character in the movie complimented each other very well the two cops were great david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters pando from two hands one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for years perth and fremantle it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with especially the old ferris wheel this rocks n rolls
a country boy aussie rules player mat goes to the city the night before an all important afl trial match where he is to be picked up by his cousin and then things go wrong his no hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan shark drug dealer tiny who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian needless to say mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos and it isn t long before thoughts of tomorrow s match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night s frantic events unravel accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country boy mat and successfully plays a part well below his age best support comes from john batchelor as tiny and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events roll is fast paced often funny and a very worthwhile use of an hour 
i ve just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be toby malone s performance really stood out i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film which itself is a lot of fun very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters quite an achievement considering it s short running time there are plenty of good twists throughout as well it will keep you guessing until the end other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don t let that put you off you could do a lot worse than checking this out you won t regret it good fun 
a film i expected very little from and only watched to pass a quiet hour but what an hour it turned out to be roll is an excellent if none too serious little story of country boy lost in the big city makes good it is funny throughout the characters are endearing and the pace is just right toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny watch out for these two highly recommended 
this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and it ll get about an rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast i am of course kidding 
plato s run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer scarface and action star jeff speaksman the expert what i liked about plato s run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato s sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato s run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it out of 
 a wrong doer is often a man that has left something undone not always he that has done something emperor marcus aurelius the dvd release of watch on the rhine could not come at a better moment it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett hellman scholar bernard f dick s audio commentary affirms his authorship it presents a subtle performance by bette davis who took a subdued secondary role long after she d become the workhorse queen at the warner bros lot equally significantly it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose sure you say like we needed that we ve heard cary grant sermonizing in destination tokyo about japanese boys and their bushido knives we ve watched jackboots stomp the living hills in the sound of music we ve toured an england callously occupied by germany in it happened here yet truth to tell we still need the message spread i have an year old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly he feels that fdr connived the u s into a foreign fight we didn t need and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin he s encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland europe or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn t confronted the nazis drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france no war would have engulfed the west he believes that without the rigors of total war no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem some commenters on this site feel that watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda maybe however neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film s point some people hurt and kill to grab other people s land goods and liberty such people dominated the axis powers and enough didn t appear in their vocabulary paul lukas deserved the oscar he won he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines for actively facing down torturers and murderers bernard dick notes that hellman didn t care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical of course as a hungarian he had seen first hand bela kun s bloody dictatorship of the proletariat replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy s right wing tyranny in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in during the plot of july th against hitler in april however he pragmatically abets the nazi cause although he insults herr blecher the butcher and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader teck a pauper and possible cuckold wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire shattering great war and the greater world wide economic depression he has no political convictions no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt out case s old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man s hostess a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way but who doesn t adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls she and her pallid office bound son belong to the american version of von ramme s and de brancovis privileged kind however this family hasn t seen ruin and never will they re moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan watch on the rhine has a manicured period look its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets yet hellman and hammett s film has gut based power audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march 
in i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday i ll keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel s the other side of venus it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy 
the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was re broadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the th century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a women only section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all time great movie moments i don t think of this as a gay movie it s an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd 
as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the s fastward to after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at http www johntopping com harvey perr war widow war_widow html
i saw this movie in my first year of living in new york i went on to live there for the next years but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie it was part of a pbs series as i recall and i ve never forgotten it there are no sex scenes to speak of just delicate moving extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement all set within a conservative boston i think world war environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war and did not seek out a career and financial independence frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail there has to be a video of this movie sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video 
almost years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender periodically i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd it s september of and i keep hoping deep sigh one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime time evening soap the other frances lee mccain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as i recall it on a short lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up and coming playwrights i watched it every time it was shown on pbs maybe or times that was before the era of vcrs so i have no record of it except in my mind s eye addition to above happy new year ladies this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper org my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer s own personal copy 
it s been a while since i ve watched this movie and the series but now i m refreshing my memory this was a very funny movie based on the classic series johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm bo and luke sneak around hogg s local construction site and find samples of coal they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip mine hazzard county unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin daisy my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn t right for the part of boss hogg and sheriff rosco p coltrane was way too serious other than that i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard 
what is wrong with you people if you weren t blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head of course the film isn t a masterpiece i don t think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it didn t bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in fast furious and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is 
having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasn t that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke s legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment it s amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series back to the movie if you watch this film in it s own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then it s not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and that s really what d o h is all about johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb and dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m c gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p coltrane the way he always should have been if you don t like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn t be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining car action movie with a few good laughs that s not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind 
i m a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters it s funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it s much cruder than the show does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren t exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasn t too keen on burt s boss hogg though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe in the movie roscoe is a little scary and who didn t have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia bikinis and car chases you won t be sorry it s just a great dumb movie 
i saw this movie when i was a child it blew me away this was before the days of television so a movie of this magnitude could send a young kid into orbit it so impressed me that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time sabu was a real delight as was rex ingram as the genie i found myself singing i want to be a sailor for months after the film left town i would recommend this movie to any and everyone i forgot to mention conrad veidt who was as villainous a character as you d ever want to meet also june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture the color was outstanding give this movie an aaa 
loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it but for me ms davis very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms davis they would be laughed off the screen i really think she phoned this one in now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more i guess i just don t get bette davis i ve always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role she s in the possible exception is now voyager i m sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this but i ll continue to watch the movies she s in because i like the stories writing supporting casts but i ll always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job 
next to star wars and the wizard of oz this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made it s a true shame it s not as well known as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci fi settings and that it s british meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that it s deserved that reputation like all great family films one can be a child an adult or even a teenager to enjoy this film i m currently but one must appreciate classic films first i absolutely adore this film it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa perhaps my favorite classic film score that rivals any john williams star wars score a fast but not flashy pace beautiful sets dialog and use of color both the sets and cinematography won oscars and state of the art oscar winning special effects for the time and some are still stunning and of course june duprez s sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta jones she even looks like jones in a way in conclusion this is one of my all time favorite movie next to the adventures of robin hood and it truly deserves more attention it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout and along with robin hood it s my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed stars excellent 
it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good casting acting all bound together with a fine rozsa score two roughly contemporary films accomplish this thief of baghdad and the adventures of robin hood some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production commenced in england in the summer of moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander korda was subsequently knighted in here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library 
this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure the genii in the bottle is a classic scene romantic in it s finish all things turn out as they should be i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true 
let s cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true arabian nights style there s an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only quibble the special effects are pretty dated loved sabu with the djinn s foot though 
a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece some of the most ravishing early technicolor a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well miles malleson who plays duprez father the sultan of basra also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose don t miss this one since posting the above comments i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i d never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer again a must see 
a fantastic arabian adventure a former king ahmad and his best friend the thief abu played by sabu of black narcissus search for ahmad s love interest who has been stolen by the new king jaffar conrad veidt there s hardly a down moment here it s always inventing new adventures for the heroes personally i found ahmad and his princess a little boring there s no need to ask why john justin who plays ahmad is listed fourth in the credits conrad veidt always a fun actor makes a great villain and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves who at one point finds a genie in a bottle i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra the father of the princess he collects amazing toys from around the world jaffar bribes him for his daughter s hand with a mechanical flying horse this probably would count as one of the great children s films of all time but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time willis o brien s stop motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn t even look remotely like a spider 
this was usually producer alexander korda s advice on set to many of his underlings the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out pushing it to six for john kobal s book the top movies his survey of film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach th place a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half way mark the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie s production shifted around england and america eventually seeing completion in and winning three technical oscars like citizen kane it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love the special effects outstanding for the time are still reasonable and actually hold up if you squint but it s not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions among them is an amusing horse constructed out of a kit model which when a key is inserted up it s rear end begins to fly there s also a killer toy of the six armed goddess kali perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrific looking giant spider also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as in a superb moment of cinematic conceit a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings and look out for the moment where he s tricked back into his bottle john justin does well as the arabic king who for some strange reason has an english accent and a stiff upper lip sabu the astonishingly muscled year old is near namesake abu a likeably cocky thief after they cross paths with the evil jaffer conrad veidt justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed s justin s perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues in truth the second half is someway the better being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature three small songs pepper the piece though as the film lasts for minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient i wouldn t classify this as a musical it s all great fun justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads veidt is the boo hiss villain and abu is the youthful irrepressible robber it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of s english movies but once you ve sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in quite commendable 
the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film alexander korda nearly went broke making this film according to the citadel film series book about the great british films adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as and spent years of planning and preparation but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle budget costs happen in us films too only cecil b demille always had a free hand at paramount after when he returned there but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film part of the way through the shoot korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon he certainly wasn t going to get scenery like that in the uk korda also finished the interiors in hollywood all in time for a release on christmas day the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography best art set direction for a color film and best special effects only miklos rosza s original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it s impossible to get bad color pictures from that place the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart both belonging to duprez this was veidt s career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant not a bad message to be sending out in at that the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today it s an eternal tale of love romance and adventure in any order you want to put it 
although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special if you ve never seen this film before you ll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney s aladdin cribbed from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers i ve given the film an out of instead of a out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final minutes the film falls apart in the pacing everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting it doesn t kill the film but it does weaken it still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie 
this was a favorite of my childhood i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time now that i m grown up and have a kid of my own i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie we watched it last friday and he liked it during abu s fight with the giant spider my son s hand crept over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared is he gonna beat the spider poppa just watch you ll see he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al raschid might as well be oz under ozma i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief and not the grown up king in fact if you deconstruct the film s narrative a bit the king is the thief s sidekick not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys it s definitely a period piece i suspect that by the time he s eleven or twelve my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented why does ahmad love the princess because the narrative demands it the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless love struck deposed king is equally improbable but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fifty foot genies and the temple of the all seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie s climax is tremendous as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last 
i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of geraldine fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in wuthering heights or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do some people think his victim was a nazi but i don t think so i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him one interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that muller lucas is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet pact after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians i think however that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after watch on the rhine was released the title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am rhein was a german army marching song used in wwii but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own wach am rhein all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his father s secret away in real life he may very well have done so 
when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enough film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia second story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you ll like in my opinion third final chapter is not special or interesting it s regular like other action movies finally i recommend to watch this movie and i hope you ll love it enjoy d
probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spot on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made a true compelling classic 
words can hardly describe it so i ll be brief the thief of bagdad was my favorite movie as a child and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me i loved this film from the first moment i saw it when i was a boy of six who had started reading the arabian nights i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu s battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled rarely has so much beauty magic and wonder been captured on film sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie georges perinal s photography is some of the best use of technicolor one of the three credited directors is michael powell a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films including a matter of life and death aka stairway to heaven and the red shoes he is one of the true masters of the camera right up there with david lean akira kurosawa and orson welles as with all great works of art the beauty of the thief of bagdad lies in the detail every frame has its own magical charm the story never lags and the characters and their actions are always involving here is a film that will never grow old 
i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess as any kid would be i was delighted with the imagination inventiveness and energy of the film several years later i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years in addition to the script the production transcends the fantasy genre this is korda the storyteller at his very best when you see thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time when you see thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece it`s as timeless as the story it treats an amazing work thomas mccarthy
this is an oriental fantasy about thousand and one arabian nights plenty of incredible adventures fantasy witchery and wizardly the malignant vizier jaffar magnificently played by conrad veidt with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince ahamad of bagdad attractive john justin who loses his throne then he escapes thanks a little thief named abu sympathetic sabu they arrive basora where ahamad and the princess gorgeous june duprez fall in love but prince and thief are haunted by jaffar ahamd is turned blind and abu is become a dog the story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring a flying mechanic horse magic bow flying carpet and of course the colossal genie overacting performed by rex ingram who gives three wishes to sabu the magic eye the figure of goddess kali with several hands among others this remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time produced by london fim s alexander korda and directed by the definitively credited ludwing berger michael powell and tim whelan with a stunning screenplay by lajos biro and miles malleson also dialogs writer and actor as sultan fond to mechanic games the wwii outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting then the three korda brothers and collaborators traveled usa continuing there the filming in especial on grand cannon colorado the splendid visual and glimmer technicolor cinematography setting and fx provoked the achieving three oscars production design by william cameron menzies and vincent korda cinematography by george perinal and special effects by osmond borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn out furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by miklos rozsa this vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs
despite having different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably well it was filmed in england nowhere near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit can t you understand it it remains a favourite of many people 
this film was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it s quality while i grew up this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well the only drawback there is is that one can not see past the bad effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child i remembered nothing of those effects of course it had been about ten years since i d seen this film when i was about eleven years old who then watches effects one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the th century coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film there is comedy romance and adventure all in one which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern it succeeds in not being dusty and old all of that is mainly due to the great story the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors in that department sabu as abu and conrad veidt as jaffar stand out providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part great film and although an oldie definitely a goldie i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday out of 
abu the thief of bagdad helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames sir alexander korda s london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights replete with swords sorcery it gave audiences in a short respite from the headlines it also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it playing the evil magician jaffar his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days here is a villain worth watching as the boyish thief sabu is perfectly cast in this his third film while not a hero in the typical sense of the word his character is certainly heroic in deed action the rest of the cast do fine work john justin is both energetic sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way sabu gets a significant part of the action when he s not transformed into a dog but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra coveted by two very different men appearing late in the film massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra forever dithering on about his mechanical toys malleson was also responsible for the film s screen play dialogue aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend mary morris later an exceptional stage actress plays the dual roles of jaffar s accomplice and the six armed silver dancer the film was begun in britain but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast the art direction in vibrant technicolor is most attractive especially the fairy tale architecture in blues whites pinks born sabu dastagir in sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore s stables when he was discovered by korda s company and set before the cameras his first four films elephant boy the drum the thief of bagdad jungle book were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films black narcissus being the one great exception his final movie walt disney s a tiger walks was an improvement but it was too late sabu had died of a heart attack in late only years of age 
the story line of the thief of bagdad is complex owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar s deeds and hate him he is imprisoned by jaffar where he meets abu the young thief the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss then he is captured when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog jaffar then asks for the princess s hand and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace accompanied by abu as his dog the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog in hopes the prince can rouse her he does awaken her she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms on his promise to restore ahmad s sight and turn abu back into a thief the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel then corks him in again for freeing him he gets three wishes his first is for sausages in the meanwhile the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy one of whose six arms stabs him to death abu makes a second wish to find ahmad the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all seeing eye abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye battling a giant spider then scaling the goddess s statue abu gazes into the eye and sees ahmad in a canyon he has the genie take him to ahmad ahmad uses the eye to see the princess she smells a flower and forgets everything at once abu wishes they were in bagdad but the genie laughs and leaves jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him omitting mention of ahmad ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess but jaffar smashes the eye abu finds himself in the land of legend where the old men who rule want to make him their king he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead to hurry to save ahmad and the princess the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner using his bow from the flying carpet to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse but another shot from the bow finishes him ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess but when he tries to make abu his vizier the young thief refuses saying that what he wants is adventure not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell with tim whelan alexander korda william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong oliver messel and marcel vertes the production apart from its gorgeous and expensive looking visual splendors i claim is dominated by two other elements the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent plus his usual intelligence and power june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan as ahmad john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role this film has a spaciousness about it that is found i assert in other korda works also its imaginative content stands in contrast to very strong realistic sets costumes and set design elements this is one of the most memorable idea level fantasies of all time worthy to be enjoyed over and over 
i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious you sons of a thousand fleas it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about am once and it had just started tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work 
 the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that s really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs it doesn t have any cheesy moments and the love story isn t a waste of time the production designs are just stunning in this movie from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter even though this movie is over years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today s cinema the music and songs are also well done anyone who sees it will no doubt hail i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies i m usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i ll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don t see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like two towers and silent hill way before today s modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place one of my favorite shots in two towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and that s what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie they re just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they re all just fantasy beings it s literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of aladdin got their inspiration the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet it s not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it s nice to know that i m not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it s amazing that s a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the s so give it a break not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today s standard if you ever wanted to see a live action version of aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won t be their cup of tea 
outstanding film of with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of encounting treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to liberty a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe 
the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all time favorite movies it is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless the casting couldn t have been better rex ingram made me believe in genies and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar he set the bar very high i watch this movie at least twice a year and never tire of it this film is an adventure for all ages no one too old to enjoy it the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u s was just about to enter wwii conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in casablanca and korda teamed up i believe with justin and dupree again in the four feathers great film making 
an utterly beautiful film one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do in thief s case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time by the s my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art house cinema when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa s stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne after escaping with a little thief played by sabu ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for sabu and love not only conquers but annihilates everything the special effects must have been mesmerising in but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from years later anyway if i m requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall s suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend in fact the stunning colours throughout sabu and rozsa s triumphant but still wistful finale conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and casablanca and then died john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted but the parts didn t call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered there s a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a positive message it s only a pity that nowadays little kids don t watch this instead of the porn they prefer one of my top film favourites i can t recommend this too much may it be shown to the end of time 
the thief of bagdad is a treasure first and foremost it is a good story though my four children s primary exposure to this tale the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights comes from the disney corporation the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability sabu who plays the young thief abu also measures up to any of today s teen actors in appeal judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say he s c u t e in the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects today of course those effects seem very dated look it s barbie flying through the air declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying yet they fit into the story well the film is after all over years old the effects fit with the script furthermore what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state of the art for the next twenty five years one need only compare the opening montage from a star trek episode to see this in that it was quite an achievement this qualifies as a family film though there are a few stabbings near the end the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation all in all a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects i recommend it 
i grew up with this as my all time favorite film the special effects are incredible for the era and won awards i can remember the dialogue as if i d heard it yesterday it is simply a great timeless adventure the music is by miklos rosza who is cinema history s best sabu is the thief conrad veidt is the grand villain i have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane whoa there rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle 
i first discovered alexander korda s fantasy the thief of bagdad in the early s on a re issue billed as the wonder show of the century both korda technicolor films the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made as the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the film s color in the way it had originally been presented in true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle s both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it nice but not as it should be now comes the m g m dvd dec issue the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once i watched it a second time the only extras are a spanish dubbed version sub titles in both english spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer thank you m g m for this exceptional dvd release now one can only hope that korda s four feathers and a restored version of korda s jungle book to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on dvd 
three flash backs introduce the main characters abu jaffar and the princess who will interact with ahmad three are the songs each linked to those same characters three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word time in his declaration of love to the princess answering her three questions at their first of three meetings so strong is the impression he causes that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her by three successive ploys deceit hypnosis and memory erasing yet jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman the whip the power and the sword three is the number of flying entities the mechanical horse the genie and the the genie and the magic carpet the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges and three are his considerations about human frailty before he departs abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn armed guards giant spider and giant octopus three are the instruments of justice the magical eye that shows abu the future the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess and the bow and arrow to execute jaffar there s magic in the number three and there is magic in this movie 
like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there s plot plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man s present where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come it must be admitted that the second half doesn t quite live up to the promise of the first like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work a freed genie a beautiful princess a flying carpet fantastic mechanical toys sea voyages a crowded marketplace a wicked vizier jewels i don t know why it all works but it does everything is just so beautiful the sets are beautiful june duprez is beautiful rozsa s score is especially beautiful as usual it sounds hungarian but somehow he manages to convince us that he s being hungarian in a persian way 
 the thief of bagdad is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar conrad veidt he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad and a gorgeous princess from her father he falls victim in the end as all tyrants do in books and legends to love and of the common man whom he ignored here embodied by the little thief sabu the armies of good and evil black and white are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms the script is poetic simply and very beautiful the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before while through its use of color it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before with flying carpet and flying white horse with a giant genie excellently played by rex ingram with evil wizards and with the good acting of sabu and veidt the thief of bagdad captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights the version remains the screen s finest fairy tale 
the story of the boy thief of bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in who starred douglas fairbanks in the first silent rendering of thief of bagdad to less imposing more recent attempts the best however remains s version which for its time was a startling magical panoply of top quality special effects those effects still work their charm no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief abu john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier jaffar played by a sinister conrad veidt the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent he and the boy abu suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado like black swirl lawrence w butler and tom howard howard incidentally did the special effects for the version of this film both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting justin s ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he s very good for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there s a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind still i don t think anyone under eight ought to see thief of bagdad this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present it was great to see computer besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them thief of bagdad is a pre war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases this is one of the best of its kind 
i have to agree with mr caruso jr lanza s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film you ll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn t good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring 
watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non aggression pact signed in august of so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line the line didn t change until a couple of months later lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work the play watch on the rhine ran from april to february for performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler eric roberts as the youngest son lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas lukas pulled an award hat trick in winning an oscar a golden globe and the new york film critics for best actor probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against humphrey bogart for casablanca gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls mickey rooney in the human comedy and walter pidgeon for madame curie every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was lukas s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas s wife was given to bette davis davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it it s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner a much lighter play than this one davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe davis lukas and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war they re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren the fly in this ointment are some other house guests a friend of davis s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas s anti fascist background his suspicions are quite correct it s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they ve become lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there his health has not been the same since his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes those decisions affect all the other members of the cast adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman s significant other coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell kurt katch clyde fillmore erwin kalser and rudolph anders coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti fascist classic casablanca though it s an item firmly planted in those specific times watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti fascist message that bears repeating infinitely 
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso check a vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano 
this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that lanza s voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did 
mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this film also starring ann blyth dorothy kirsten eduard franz and ludwig donath this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world renowned tenor whose name is known even today the film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten judmila novotna blanche thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film if you re a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from lucia will strike you as odd even if caruso s wife dorothy just had a baby girl also it s highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia the role lay too high for him in taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso s life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the laundry he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking machine company later rca victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake instead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a hemorrhage during l elisir d amore at the met and could not finish the performance he only sang three more times at the met his last role as eleazar in la juive what killed him the same thing that killed valentino peritonitis his first role at the met was not radames in aida as indicated in the film but the duke in rigoletto so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy caruso s biography of her husband that s what it was suggested what is true is that dorothy s father disowned her after her marriage and left her of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of on however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy some people say that lanza s voice is remarkably like caruso s but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point caruso s voice is remarkably unlike lanza s in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a baritone he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic tenor role which lanza definitely was not lanza s voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a robust energy he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same 
yes be my love was mario lanza s skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema asthma ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful 
since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro goldwyn mayer had mario lanza under contract no one else could have done it i doubt whether it will ever be tried again and why should it i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen for his tenor voice was his life his reason for being on the earth to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest caruso like the man who portrayed him was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought he s shown in a recording studio once late in his life actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men it s why both became the legends that they are what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn t get an actual cast album with ann blyth dorothy kirsten and jarmila novotna also though blyth sang it in the film lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso if you re looking for a life of enrico caruso this ain t it if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career than you should not miss the great caruso 
the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most movergoers were stay at homes watching their new motorola televisions almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously today s movies will dominate in it cost c to at radio city c to c first run at loew s palace in washington dc or c to c in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead of the movie s focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result was a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom took his place with lanza s voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it s almost always on ebay for or less don t be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie 
i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves i e what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions 
jesse and celine ethan hawke and julie delpy are two strangers on a european train the two come from widely different backgrounds he s american and she s french after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise this wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline written and directed by richard dazed and confused linklater before sunrise never bores because of its small cast in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans 
amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding instead of relying on clich s and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments the lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving thought provoking funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany s will soften even the hardiest heart 
i m not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i ve ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they re a couple the movies grabs you right away and doesn t let go you can t look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece 
an american woman her european husband and children return to her mother s home in watch on the rhine a film based on the play by lillian hellman and starring paul lukas whom i believe is repeating his stage role here bette davis lucile watson george coulouris geraldine fitzgerald and donald woods an anti fascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the nazis kurt muller lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother in law but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests coulouris is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth lillian hellman s liberal point of view it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes the movie s big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in casablanca humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick but lukas is transcendent as kurt the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut wrenching just to mention one scene though this isn t what one thinks of as a bette davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as kurt s loyal and loving wife sara her acting tugs at the heart and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions lillian hellman is not everyone s cup of tea but unlike the little foxes she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers highly recommended 
i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago having saw it twice i couldn t help but missing before sunrise not because the sequel was not as great but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did every time i finished watching one of them i feel the need and yearning to see the other so i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other it sounds so simple the growing of the chemistry i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development but to me who doesn t believe in nora ephron before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it when i saw it for the first time about year ago when i was i already liked it but i didn t rate it as a great film it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie linklater was too smart to make it more realistic it was minutes too long the characters was too well fabricated i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations etc etc but now thanks to before sunset i feel that s more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before i saw the elements more clearly jesse celine vienna their conversations everything how each of them are separated element by itself and they have a chance to mix the story is just a frame of time i am no longer feel manipulated and the freedom that every scene has as well as its refusal to be overly efficient how blind i was that those qualities didn t strike me as exceptional when i first saw it now year have passed the more movies i ve seen the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters s own slackers included the jesse and celine tale avoid that maybe before sunset is a better example in this case but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time not a destination every single scene has its own life i don t know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise but to me one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it meanwhile i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset and celine s first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i ve seen in a beginning of a film and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don t know with a sadness in me no matter how beautiful paris is and no matter how happy i am that they meet again i m sorry that i go on this long with my limited english before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it 
i m not even sure what to say about this film it s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings romantic love out of watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger 
i must admit that at the beginning i was sort of reticent about watching this movie i thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie still i watched it and i was amazed before sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy tales the ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o clock in vienna s station in our optimism we sincerely hope so the actors acted in a very good manner so that i began to believe that i myself could live a love story just like this 
american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa on the train he met a french girl celine although they met the first time they talked like good friends when the train stopped at vienna jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna then the romantic story unfolded at first they were cautious the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store they peeked at each other though their eyes did not contact after in depth conversation they relationship became close then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words love is a strange thing when you really want it it will not come as you wished love needs mutual understanding without it love will not last long spiritual harmony is the most important for love excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie one of the best romance movies 
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love by far the most romantic at least one of them movie of all times 
my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending hrs the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with on the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer s and director s mind what the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story here both the actors do just the right job kudos and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful 
i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise and before sunset and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain why before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead poets society only at the time of the film s release and julie delpy the three colors trilogy then although looking much younger he is a promiscuous american writer touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the budapest vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love the film has s written all over it back then technology was leaping rapidly the new millennium with all it s hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy with all their flaws and inconsistencies celine s accent if by mistake or on purpose was half american half french and it swinged from one spectrum to the other breaking the character s credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clich d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesn t let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while all in all sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic rendezvous and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future 
this is a slow moving story no action no crazy suspense no abrupt surprises if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey dovey romance don t waste your time and money on the other hand if you re into dialog masterful story telling thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert though because the pace the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood it s truly fantastic i really mean that ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but thankfully the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural warm and tender they act and feel each other out from the very beginning making you feel as an intruder in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence still it did not ruin the movie the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it s charm and ultimately it s power bottom line the movie s flow is slow the dialog is fascinating the story builds gently systematically and substantive the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding 
after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna discussing life and love the primary reason to see before sunrise is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines as celine this sexy brainy soulful brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid twenties risking overstatement celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar ethan hawke as jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a maynard g krebs of the nineties attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots his pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine his oft cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he contents himself with a half baked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably won t show while jesse who ends up working at target or if he s lucky the local library will go back to vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion before sunrise is a beautiful movie i highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset 
when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in via a free advanced screening i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended i on the other hand felt completely the opposite i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else people i talked to said there was too much talking plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie going public seems to have a tendency to want easy to follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused they also like to be spoon fed tidy endings happy or sad this disgusts me nobody wants to be challenged anymore and as for the ending and i don t want to be a spoiler i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again it s all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny it s a very personal film that doesn t speak to all people but it certainly spoke to me give it a chance be patient with it richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass it s very intimate plus ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life they must have improvised during some parts and it works well they have a great chemistry in their roles their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much bravo for romance 
ever since i can remember and i m only my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey don t get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the s and s anyways now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed the children did not act like children in the slightest but there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence so people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see paul lukas dear paul did an amazing job now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn t but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way but lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone d
this movie is intelligent that is more than most other movies it transcends the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also relies heavily on dialogue it has some parallels to lost in translation although before sunrise is much brighter somehow less abstract and simply a lot better the script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together the dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does however stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes it yields great results and overall this movie is simply stupendous only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic every time that is achieved the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film years after this is simply a gem of a movie that you can t miss one of the best movies i have seen from the s 
before sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it s suffice to say that it s one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love per say so much as it s about a human connection how does one fall in love at first sight no one does at least that s deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the town in vienna until his plane the next morning before sunrise gives jessie and celine in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it s like to watch people having one leading into another and another here it s often about relationships and commitments as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities we hear confessions of desires for other loves or what weren t really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you ll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul i loved the bit about the quakers in the church and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what s fascinating about the film is that it s never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives meanwhile it s always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles where they re not incessantly annoying in that s generation x mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isn t a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable i have to tell you a secret jessie says and then leans in for a kiss ho ho or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way i loved the scene with the poet where it s very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it first hand all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however self contained as it may lead into something more who s to say you can t suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than hours and be that much more attached than a married couple this is perhaps linklater s thesis but there s more to it than just that it s a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly one scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other s friend a 
this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i ve ever seen closely followed by none other than before sunset which technically isn t another movie at all since it s about the same two people and the same romance this is love in the real world ok that s only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie reading the other reviews it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog based movies as well and this is what makes before sunrise so good the dialog is perfect it s so real so engaging and funny it s hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love coz you fall in love with them at the very same time my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their best friends with the other pretending to be said best friend it s perfect brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life i must say that if you have a choice do watch before sunrise before watching before sunset if like me you watched sunset first it s hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show once again the greatest romantic movie in my books wonderful acting excellent script and beautiful locations young love at it s best 
richard linklater s beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the s best thinking person s romantic movies julie delpy turns in one of the decade s most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger on a train ethan hawke the dialogue and there is oodles of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers making a romantic intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing touching and insightful moments 
sweet and charming funny and poignant plot less but meaningful before sunrise the third movie of richard linklater is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love is in love or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it it is one of the very rare movies that is should will be equally interesting to teenagers their parents and even grandparents it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects car chases or long and steamy sex scenes two young people in their early s two college students american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne meet on a train they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night they talk and fall in love that s it that s the movie it could ve been boring and silly but instead it is a lovely believable clever and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least for this viewer high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters superb writing always interesting and witty dialogs two awesome performances and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is julie delpy who looks like a botticelli s angel is great in portraying smart independent and incredibly attractive young woman 
first let me say that before sunrise like all movies is not a movie for all tastes it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people for me like most folks here before sunrise struck a deep chord in me i was truly stunned moved inspired by it this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other it is very intelligent and inspiring not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine s discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other it captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world and what happens after that night is open for debate but i never doubt that they won t each other again the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie see it and it may change your way of life 
i watched this movie years ago and have watched it on video an average of once a year since it s the type of movie that s timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal it s also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two very involving characters this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv and now the phenomenon is rampant i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters it also made me want to ride the train around europe i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie 
there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don t meet these people anymore we don t always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are it s funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because reuniting might spoil fond memories or we don t know do they we are too afraid to check that out the movie before sunrise just caught me watching it i never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting i gave a look for the rest of the film i didn t know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives 
if you are a traveller if there is a fire burning into your heart if you d call home every place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there see this movie and you ll find out a little but wonderful piece of life sitting next to you 
i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and it s also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the s it s impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but it s not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it 
many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the mortal storm or casablanca everyone is entitled to compare films they choose but the similarities of the mortal storm and watch on the rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point brought out with casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in by the academy of motion picture arts and science because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar it does not strike me as totally wrong lukas had a good career in film both here and in england he is the villain in the lady vanishes and this performance was his best one bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine for instance he was ignored for sam spade in the maltese falcon and roy earle in high sierra two years earlier both of which were first rate performances and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c dobbs in the treasure of sierra madres the writer murder suspect in in a lonely place and captain philip francis queeg in the caine mutiny afterward he got it for charley in the african queen i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs but it did not happen but lukas was lucky he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career few can claim that to me the film to look at with watch on the rhine is based on another play script by hellman the searching wind they both look at america s spirit of isolationism in the s and s the searching wind is really looking at the whole inter war period while watch on the rhine set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii deals with a few weeks of time therefore it is better constructed as a play and more meaningful for it s impact the film has many good performances led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter courier davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play s activities coulouris as the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald as coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife and kurt katch who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassy s gestapo chief about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis it has dialog with bite in it and what it says is quite true it also has moments of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis and says the new world has left the scene to the old world hellman could write very well at times given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films 
it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other ethan hawke jesse tape and julie delpy celine er tv series nicole this gal and guy will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years jesse and celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in and if you have viewed this film you will feel the same way 
 before sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top favorite movies ever dialog and acting are great i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts of course the romantic vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you won t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isn t possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if you re a stranger and it s your first night in vienna but that s not the point the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring the ending is genuinely sad without being titanic or something even if you don t like love stories you should watch this film i m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer the first part is perfect as it is in my opinion 
i want c line and jessie go further in their relationship i want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached this is about love but not stupid things like in notting hills or those kind of movie this is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling this was so clever and touching i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there i want to go to vienna i want to see them as soon as possible again i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happen i m french and didn t know very well july delpy despite kieslowski three colors white now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting i saw before sunset the sequel in paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter they are both masterpieces proof that you don t need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings i m sorry for my english which i m trying to best franck in france
while traveling by train through europe the american jesse ethan hawke and the french celine julie delpy meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria on the next morning jesse returns to united states of america and celine to paris before sunrise is one of my favorite romances indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect and the dialogs are stunning the direction is amazing transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer i have just completed my review number in imdb and i choose before sunrise for this significant number because it is a very special film for me i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar with such a magnificent screenplay direction and performances yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time and i still love it my vote is ten title brazil antes do amanhecer before sunrise 
before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation richard linklater s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people the film depicts romance in all it s glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time while most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders the story follows two people jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna they instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna before sunrise works principally for two reasons realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life this allows the characters to be free and it s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because they re the protagonists this kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that they re watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen a truly great script cannot work on it s own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although i m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect i don t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly matters in a film like this it is the writing that s the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which i personally could relate to this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that s the case with the musings in this script adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna the city itself isn t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental before sunrise is what it is and what it is is pure cinematic brilliance 
this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy meets girl movies ever made while rebel without a cause and say anything deliver nice portrayals this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it this movie is mostly all dialogue based but every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is how in all that conversation while often having no real bearing on anything critical you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests and no matter how many times i watch this film i don t think i will ever tire of that 
this movie is not about entertainment or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed god s love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal there is the love in a marriage while the main character grapples with his wife s disease he realizes through god s love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated finally you have the love of child and parent the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear dear friends love is not love unless it comes from god because god is love and love comes from god talk to someone and let them know you love them love does no good unless it is given to another i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it amen 
forget the campy religious movies that have monopolized the television film market this movie has a real feel to it while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals however i did not like the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this oversight definitely worth seeing buy the dvd 
this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer s or who are in the formative stages i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line 
i wasn t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you d expect to be living next door they are ordinary flesh and blood people not like the typical hollywood fare they face an all too common problem debilitating illness but the story line grips the heart with a powerful lesson casting script direction and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire 
lillian hellman one of america s most famous women playwrights was a woman with a mission her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country in her memoir she recounts her trip to the then soviet union as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system watch on the rhine must have come as a result of those years the left wing in america as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism not only in europe but in japan as well watch on the rhine was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese in it ms hellman was heralding america s entrance in world war ii the adaptation is credited to ms hellman and dashiell hammett her long time companion as directed for the screen by herman shumlin the film was well received when it premiered in we are introduced to the muller family when the film opens they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico they are to continue toward mrs muller s home in washington d c where her mother fanny farrelly is a minor celebrity hostess the mullers we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany in fact we thought in a way the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish fleeing from a sure extermination we find out that mr muller has had a terrible time in his native land as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim little does he know that he is coming to his mother in law s house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy the film offers excellent acting all around it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis supporting role paul lukas repeating his broadway role is quite convincing as kurt muller the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family mr lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway the other best performance is by lucile watson who plays fanny farrelly the matriarch of this family geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis a guest of the farrellys married to the contemptible teck de brancovis a nazi sympathizer played by george coulouris beulah bondi donald woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr shumlin the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule no matter where 
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i d have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie it s based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how you d respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family member in other words everyone though the production isn t quite hollywood quality no big special effects still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill you don t want to miss this 
i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time it is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values inspiring and touching 
when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film yet having read the content i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me a vow to cherish is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema first the entire content is particularly educational it has something to offer to the modern audience pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions is there a need for christ in our times does love still matter what for is there faith what is the logics of burden and suffering in life is there really someone by my side i can always trust the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us second the movie is exceptionally humane the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions is it better for kyle david denman and teri megan paul to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home is it better for john ken howard to leave ellen barbara babcock his sick wife and start a new happy life with julia donna bullock a woman he falls in love with in fact ellen no longer recognizes him yet he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity had john s rebellious brother phil d david morin better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life phil s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together this something is love and trust i know that it may seem a bit idealistic not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one fourth the entire film focuses on people s mutual help if we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing we have to help one another alexander ossie davis is an example of such attitude at the beginning of the movie we see him talk to john about praying later he helps his brother alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to john and his family isn t it possible that we may become angels to one another fifth the artistic features are also worth attention performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves autumn while the sunshine love spreads everywhere i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joy a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe at the end i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do kyle to his uncle phil yes he john brighton lives according to the bible but nobody forces you to do so yet according to what rules do you live 
for all of you that don t speak swedish the swedish [original] title of this film r narna translates into something in the line of the robbers this fact is the main problem i have with the film cause it s not really about the robbers at all it s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies a regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers exactly we ve seen this before the fact that there s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn t really help as the ending is just as clich as the first two thirds of the film what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it s masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and don t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it s music sets the right mood when it s needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car chases spread throughout the film a nice touch the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but that s something you have to neglect all in all it s an entertaining film that steals more money in it s plot than time from you 
even this early in his career capra was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing this is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately the first part looks like a cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich prince will lose his fortune nonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace it s easy to get caught up in the clich s then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living the ending is very predictable but satisfying i also want to compliment the title writing very witty and fun 
that certain thing is the story of a gold digger viola dana from a tenement house her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers but they are a loving family although dana s character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor she refuses and holds out for a millionaire everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain the two marry hastily but the girl s dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger however she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana this film is a lot of fun dana s role is accessible natural and entertaining she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility the title cards are also incredibly clever if you like films like my best girl it or the patsy you will enjoy this film 
but sadly due to rights issues that almost certainly will never happen transcripts of joe bob s commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet but they don t quite capture his twang inflected delivery which was a real hoot nowadays joe bob real name john bloom is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as i spit on your grave featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time and jason x one of the most reviled friday the th sequels of all time the series was never the same once it left paramount all i could think when they canceled it was damn where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping blonde jokes and horror trivia every saturday night does this mean i have to get a life now sadly it does but there ll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for monstervision long live the drive in 
monstervision was a show i grew up with from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one the only joe bob briggs the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years and provided some of the best drive in memories to ever come outside of the drive in without a doubt the best late night television ever if you didn t stay up you were missing out i know john bloom and joe bob live on but i want them back where they belong monstervision question did anyone else sit through all hours of the swarm q long live monstervision 
i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in i was at the time and now at the age of it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it the s all of a sudden seem so far away what a great decade anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films it was like the s version of chiller theater if mst k can get dvd s why not joe bob s show at least monstervision was more interesting and informative a lot of joe bob s comments and info on the films were just hilarious most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen many were oddball flicks that you wouldn t see anywhere else like the the japanese sci fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show i m sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day i guess will have to wait and see until then thats great television 
probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it s not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some or more times in the last years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressed up midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mother s slow awakening to what s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they d all be up for this movie 
i ll tell you a tale of the summer of a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie and it was a who s who of the top canadian bands of the age we got there about am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at am we were among the first inside the gates we then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didn t care because the headliners were among our favourites at one point early in the afternoon i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t shirt this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day there s nothing reasonable nor taste determined nor really anything except their fandom snotty of me isn t it so i in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is whale music desmond howl had it all it s hard to say what he s lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in and trite as it sounds breaks him out canadian cinema suffers from several problems generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian leads to lower production values than american or british films and most people don t like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an american film next canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often full frontal makes something artistic i m sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies especially late at night on the cbc knows exactly what i m talking about it s almost like a don t do this handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film makers threw it out a long time ago in the s and s however some films such as bruce mcdonald s work and the brilliant c r a z y have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories whale music is such a film on the surface deeper than just its canadian isms it s a deeply moving story of a man who s lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love and that redeems even the rheostatics 
i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business who are now still trying to become adults no more fans groupies money etc and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight it is almost like they have to begin anew this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the s and s are going through now and that s where i find the film sad and depressing but it portrays the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost in a believable way the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren outrageous and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their s who have seen the rise and fall of bands people who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps in and popularity fades this is an almost perfect movie sad but in a way positive because of the whales a must see 
anyone who loves the rheostatics music is going to enjoy this film i have some minor complaints mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors not maury who aren t really convincing in their roles but i don t have time write a detailed review i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader s digest version of whale music don t watch it it cuts out entire scenes and subplots if you can them that from the film the cbc which presents most of films untouched took half the guts out of whale music i don t know why it s horrible what they did to the film rent the video or watch it in a theatre but don t watch it on cbc television 
i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie for some reason it clicked on all my levels tensions in a family loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with it didn t hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire cyndy preston i also bought the sound track to this movie very hard to get loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv
i was amazingly impressed by this movie it contained fundamental elements of depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams and companionship it wasn t merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music he finds a companion who comes with her own issues claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star yet he has musical genius he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate while things around him literally go to ruins his focus is creating his whale music in fact it becomes an obsession for him claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay she finds hidden talents while being in des company she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her she learns to trust him over a period of time these two find love with one another not the mind blowing sex infused kind of passion but a love where friendship and understanding means more for two people who have been hurt they find trust together 
a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movie s main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i m not very sure whether or not that s flattering portrayal this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love stories in general i m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but there s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy 
my first exposure to whale music was the rheostatics album of the same name that i bought around i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album which remains in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington s book i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it an amazing read i have since re read the book numerous times each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music i found the film in on video i haven t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film but this one worked for me the role of claire could have been cast differently but overall i think that paul quarrington s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius the movie deals with family relationships love and finding someone who understands i would strongly recommend whale music to not only music fans but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world 
walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema how do you get laughs out of other people s misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since those other races used it undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world an extraordinary dvd extra commentary two of them in fact run thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take what a hoot don t miss it stars
 this is definitely a must see for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide out trying to avoid being caught by parents teachers the police etc the protagonist is a lady in her forties living in her mansion breeding orchids and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her when he all of the sudden dies she is confronted with the truth the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt she doesn t know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead the story is quite original the performances outstanding i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one still the melodramatic touch is present the film is typical british the jokes aren t vulgar there is no violence involved it shouldn t be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching saving grace it will be so much more fun especially the scene with the old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious i thought my jawbones would burst 
this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am i glad he did the blend of british humor should i say humour and the reality of a lost middle aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights maybe it s just my mendocino county blood but the brits definitely got this one right 
it may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca role for the best actor oscar i still would have given the oscar to bogie but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination at least well i m glad i did check this movie out because i enjoyed it immensely i think the movie did preach a little but not only did i not mind i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them the acting was outstanding in this movie i especially enjoyed paul lukas lucile watson rightfully nominated for an oscar bette davis wrongfully not nominated george coulouris and oddly eric roberts who plays the middle child i really enjoyed his character an odd looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher he just cracks me up even the characters name bodo is funny the ending in which lukas s character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and i understood why he couldn t quite explain it the message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent watch this movie if you ever get a chance 
this is an hilarious movie one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor from the largest role to the smallest each character is vivid unforgettable and so understandable it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve 
a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother saving grace seems cut from the same cloth as a half dozen other british comedies over the past two years underdog is faced with adversity finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him herself in the process widowed and thus broke grace is a master gardener and is enlisted to help her friend employee matthew grow his pot plant he s been doing it all wrong so grace helps him out they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot which they can both benefit from he enjoys smoking she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in saturday night fever and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb blethyn is always watchable and you can t say that about a lot of people well i can t anyway ferguson is very good and tcheky karyo who i liked in la femme nikita is memorable not profoundly moving or insightful but immensely entertaining and at a brisk minutes feels like a walk with friends 
i love this film it s one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesn t try too hard to be star studded the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completely the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes no that s not a spoiler 
yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award material but then it doesn t try to be anything it is not a fun filled romp with real funny one liners a stellar and very funny performance by peter o toole a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright the band s performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a deft comical manner the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads a good example is the comment about the strange baseball like game well my dear american that was cricket from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket also no you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said oh yes to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money jeez it seems that every joke must be explained to some people all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs well worth seeing 
charming doesn t even begin to describe saving grace it s absolutely irresistible anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high haha grace trevethyn brenda blethyn has just lost her husband but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts faced with losing everything she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash fast she gets an idea when her gardener matthew craig ferguson asks the town famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top quality weed and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts the most notable quality about saving grace is its likability every character is extremely sympathetic and save for the first or so minutes the film is non stop good cheer everyone wants a happy ending for everyone even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities the acting is top notch brenda blethyn is one of britain s finest actresses and here is why she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual she s a nice lady but she s not stupid craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew he s a deadbeat loser but he s so likable that it doesn t matter the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo the french actor always has a aura of menace about him and that suits him well but he also has great comedy skills nigel cole finds the perfect tone for saving grace it s all about the charm one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film not so here the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing that s not to say that saving grace is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling while this movie is not an out and out comedy it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical if there s any problem with the film it s that the climax is a little confusing the questions are answered though and the ending boasts an unexpected twist see saving grace especially when you re having a bad day 
i saw it last night on tv and was quite delighted it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite realistic i loved acting they all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small picturesque english coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their tea perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing but it didn t stop me from really really enjoying the whole story 
 saving grace is never riotously funny but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree brenda blethyn is a fine actress and does a good job at portraying widower grace who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts the supporting cast also does a fine job french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role the premise alone is appealing the idea of an over the hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then of course there are flat moments like one where two elderly women mistaken grace s marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work that was a mindless gag that didn t quite take off the film s tone is downbeat and occasionally dull but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation my score out of 
saving grace is a feel good movie with it s heart in the right place grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana she s living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors there s only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it s user it s obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny it s precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable 
after her oscar nominated turn in secrets lies brenda blethyn starred in the equally great saving grace and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day after her husband commits suicide grace trevethyn brenda blethyn discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana that s right grace starts cultivating it every aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn t a dull moment anywhere in it and i sure didn t see that end scene coming but anyway you gotta see this movie you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it if nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one s finances but of course there s a lot more to it than that 
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you haven t spent any time on that side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played she s a true lady and my favorite is grace s white pimp suit that she wears i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different 
for muslim women in western africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course enables it to continue fortunately the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children what is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their informality the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if a case is actually bought the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life style which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin english they speak overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine 
yet another example of what british cinema can achieve a simple story told and acted well brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace ably assisted by a solid supporting cast the quirky small town card gets played to the hilt similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years ballykissangel hamish macbeth and others come to mind like the forementioned this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery in this case the wet and wild cornish coast some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe but it s an enjoyable spliff to be sure 
a delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce the last five minutes cost it points in my rating despite this major plot and style flaw it s worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting many fine little bits to savor like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card made more piquant when we re not quite sure the card is not maxed 
i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then it s become one of my favorites the plot isn t particularly complex but it doesn t take away from the entertainment it s chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda blythen she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if you re looking for a good comedy i d definately recommend this movie 
this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it s not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so don t think that it s a chick flic 
excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town it s mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldn t stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore i love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned devine saving grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it 
saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun i mean the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness it was the first movie i watched with this theme drugs marijuana that is not really criticizing it only making jokes about it grace trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in u k and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide since he was full of debts the problem is that grace who imagined to have some money saved for her discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband s pounds in debts to not lose all of her things specially her house that she loves so much she never worked before and is in a tragic situation until matthew her gardener who is very found of smoking pot decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale 
great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag and thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the stoned ladies in the tea shop scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time 
i just thought it was excellent and i still do i m grateful we re still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with saving grace is smart and enjoyable those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america s bride sort of movie saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn t have to be stupid i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband s debts in a nutshell a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing you couldn t ask for more 
it s a bit easy that s about it the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are d but that s forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it s the same for every platform game like banjo kazooie and donkey kong i got this game as a christmas present in and since then i have dutifully gotten stars over times 
mario s first foray into the world of dimensions is incredible miyamoto s masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo when it was released in and it still holds all of it s charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for d adventure platform games 
sisters in law will be released theatrically on march th in sweden a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary it was shown in g teborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto director in focus of the festival she gave a master class very much appreciated telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice the first version got lost for good so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end a pretty awful problem happened in this case to create the possibility of a very strong movie 
this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you don t need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn t close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future 
although super mario isn t like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isn t very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn t take away from the game at all once you beat it you ll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 
super mario is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break i ve beaten the game times but i ve never gotten all stars i ve gotten but i hope to achieve them eventually even though i didn t officially play this game until i was seven in i loved watching my sisters play it now i am and still play this erasing games and starting over again the graphics are unbelievable for an early n game the gameplay is addictive the controls are great the levels are tough but not impossible the bowser fights are challenging i would like to tell you more but why don t you just get it for yourself put the x box ps and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo and play this amazing wonderful game 
one of the funnest mario s i ve ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time there s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i d still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but it s very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine 
when i first got my n when i was five or six i fell in love with it and my first game was super mario and i loved it the graphics were great for it s time a good plot great courses and above all the best music i heard in a nintendo game i don t remember the plot completely but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser and mario has to rescue her the object of the game is to get stars from the curses in the castle each had about five or six challnges to get the stars there are secert parts of the castle where you can get more stars but of course you have beat bowser i think there are three levels to beat bowser on lets start with the characters mario is the main character and gets helpful advice from toad so he is basically one of your only alliances i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end the main villain is bowser and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba the characters are really great next how about the graphics people say gameplay is more important then the graphics and i agree completely but with he great plot there are great graphics especially for it s time i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like and their graphics don t compare to super mario bright colors great effects and awesome sound effects i found the graphics in the water courses very very good next to the bowser world ones it has the best graphics in the game now the music this is my favorite part of the game growing up when i played this at a young age i d gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep especially the music from jolly roger bay which was peaceful and wonderful there are others that are great too especially in once again the worlds with bowser are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer and i love it this game gets or go play the game 
or at least one of the best i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n bowser is up to his usual shenanigans yeah it s a dumb word but the only one i can think of and mario must stop him again this game is very fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia to me the only bad thing about it is the graphics which are awful to today s standards but everything else is pretty good especially the little mini games you can unlock it s the second best n game the first best is conker s bad fur day that i recommend to any mario fan or any fan of platform games it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day or a
yes that s right it is i firmly believe that the n and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made it was amazing the first time i saw it with its huge environments and colorful characters and its amazing now the play control is perfect the graphics are beautiful and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there a must have for any n owner and a reason to get an n for everyone else 
rated e i never actually owned a nintendo but i have played one many times in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day super mario is one of the best video games for the nintendo system i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time if you have an n and don t have this game you should try to find it the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario has a d mario in a nice d environment the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the power stars from bowzer now you can do it in a d environment super mario is a very fun and good n game and i recommend it 
this game is amazing really you should get it if you don t have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic it s just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did it s not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential it s fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics well it did come out in rock on eva mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best 
mario is invited to princess peach s castle for cake when mario gets there he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her mario must save the day again unlike the d games mario can explore anything he wants to he can just roam around climb trees trying to look for ups find secrets in levels and more you can spend four hours in one level no time limits there are worlds with a number of stages and there are star doors which you need a certain number of stars to get into once you get in these star doors you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage to get to certain worlds you need a number of stars to get in you enter the world by going through a painting there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay i don t see how anyone could dislike this game it s great this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n would have a good life every d plat form game we know of has something in common with sm banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used super mario is one of the greatest games in the history of d games out of if you have an n buy this game it s hard to find used because no one s selling this baby for bucks at the pawn shop a perfect 
i have not read the novel though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book having not read a single word of austen s writing i really can t compare this to any of her work what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever witty and well delivered as well as the biggest source of comedy in this this made me laugh out loud a lot with perfect british and verbal material every acting performance is spot on and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker the characters are well written credible and consistent i did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny it tended to get repeated excessively and it honestly wasn t amusing the first time they appeared the editing and cinematography are marvelous and everything looks utterly gorgeous plot and pacing are great you re never bored it does end in a really obvious manner but maybe that s what the audience of these prefer i can t claim that this did not entertain me it did from start to finish and i d watch it again there is brief language in this i recommend this to any fan of romance stories 
this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun s judicial system policewomen lawyers and judges despite tremendous difficulties lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants these brave strong women are making a difference this is a rare thing a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate hardworking women i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states the more people who see this film the better 
this is an ok adaptation but not as good as the tv version the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again i preferred kate beckinsale s emma there are excellent support performances from toni collette juliet stephenson and sophy thompson the script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set piece gags here and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent my biggest criticism is the scenery it is far too lush england has never been like this it looks like a chocolate box only americans would make it like this despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more 
 emma woodhouse gwyneth paltrow shakespeare in love duets has nothing to do with herself but painting going with her friends on her chariot up and down saying hello to people in town and trying to match make everybody she knows i guess there were no movies no television in those days and the girls had nothing to do but gossip i wish she had read a little more i like gwyneth and think that she is a lovely young woman she is talented and in emma one has the privilege to hear gwyneth sing i am looking forward to seeing duets where she is suppose to sing she is brave to speak british english with all those native britons including emma thompson s sister miss bates sophie thompson four weddings and a funeral dancing at lughnasa mrs elton juliet stevenson truly madly deeply was considered one of the most promising actors in gwyneth is part of the american movie royalty being none other than the daughter of director bruce paltrow st elsewhere and tony award winner blythe danner the myth of fingerprints she will hopefully be around for a real long time lucky us i liked emma and also recommend it it is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days favorite scenes emma singing and playing the piano i specially like it when she sings a duet favorite quotes mr knightley emma you didn t ask me to contribute a riddle emma your entire personality is a riddle mr knightley i thought you overqualified miss bates it left us speechless quite speechless i tell you and we have not stopped talking of it since 
first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd it is on of my favorite movies of all time i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr knightley was an excellent chose he was brilliant it s a movie 
if you have any clue about jane austen s production you ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but i like austen s characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow she s very good in her leading role also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious 
emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel i have not read the book so i really didn t know that much about the plot and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better ewan mecgreger who has also been better but he is still very good here alan cumming who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and jeremy northam who s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching 
a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i m sure i don t know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane austen s most accessible and least stuffy story told well 
 emma was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid nineties and it was recently shown on british television doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with pride and prejudice two years ago we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic becoming jane and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels these include northanger abbey the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously so the cycle should now be complete no doubt however there will be more to come in the near future there is after all her juvenile love and freindship sic the short novella lady susan and someone somewhere has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments the watsons and sanditon then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers the main character is emma woodhouse a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england not as some reviewers have assumed victorian england austen died before queen victoria was even born emma is financially considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton this scheme goes disastrously wrong however as elton has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications emma always insists that she will not marry without affection and when she does find a partner the handsome mr knightley we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage it does not however seem likely to be a very passionate one unlike say that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy knightley who is sixteen years older than emma she is he and related to her by marriage is more like a father figure than a lover much more of a father figure in fact than her actual father a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenth century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well but this is not really one of the great screen romances of the other characters i liked juliet stephenson s vulgar mrs elton and toni collette s harriet i know that in the novel harriet was a na ve young teenager whereas here she is more like the character collette played in muriel s wedding a gauche slightly overweight twentysomething fretting about her chances of finding a man nevertheless i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen s themes emma is one of austen s more light hearted works without the darker overtones of mansfield park or even pride and prejudice and this is reflected on screen we see a world of beauty and grace full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners apart from the ruffianly gypsies who make a very brief appearance the only poor people we see are mrs bates and her daughter and as they live in the sort of picturesque rose strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over we can be sure that their poverty is relative not absolute in emma s world poverty is defined as not having your own stately home this is of course not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth century life but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen sink realist sophisticated romantic comedy combined with a keen eye for analysing human character was more in her line i would not rate this film quite as highly as the sense and sensibility or the recent pride and prejudice it tends to drag a bit in the middle although it has a strong beginning and strong ending but it is in the main a highly enjoyable austen adaptation 
lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen s satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial th century england northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and i thought it didn t rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the s and s do very good results 
wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways emma gwyneth paltrow is a graceful intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess and confidant to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her she decides to match the vicar mr elton alan cummings with her pretty young friend harriet toni collette the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought the film is full of jane austen s witty and wry characterizations gwyneth paltrow is at her best portraying this maiden of a restrained polite society with wit and ease her growing romance with the unparalleled mr knightley jeremy northam is the heart of this film mr knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films he is incredibly handsome in a modest relaxed way that is irresistible he is certainly well matched to gwyneth paltrow their charming friendship that began when he was and she was an infant has blossomed as he a family friend matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more with a wry look or understated jab at emma northam s knightley is a delight to watch other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson greta scacchi ewan mcgregor polly walker and the talkative spinster miss bates who is very funny seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment 
i m a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature length film a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini series it was really great gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr knightly with his poise and nobility i wasn t thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn t feel it spoiled the movie at all like i said as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren t but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well i ve seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one 
this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon the sisters in law are female lawyers and judges who in successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council it is rather long about two hours but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges it will leave you as it left me with many questions about exactly how this change occurred how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court against the express wishes of the husband a one time event i m not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions they made the movie two years ago not yesterday and the movie they made deserves a wide audience 
i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this transposition is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense in a word perfect emma is one of austen s most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters the movie respected this subtle irony not disregarding the comic element miss bates above all what engaged me in the novel and the movie renders it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me we can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern i think of the morbid interest in other people s lives or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women s relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one s feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and out of time value the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it toni colette is simply great and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear and then the breathtaking english countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie 
well i guess i m emotionally attached to this movie since it s the first one i went to see more than times in the cinema helping me through my master s thesis or rather keeping me from working on it but on watching it again several years and many many movies later what a well crafted little gem this is i ve never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley where does one meet such a man sigh sophie thompson s turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest oh napkins sorry and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect impossible couple of course the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood almost hobbiton like atmosphere of the movie although as far as cinematography and art decoration go it s almost a case of visual overload very very pretty but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period but the good thing is the movie doesn t take itself too seriously and there is plenty of fun and some pretty cool editing that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode my particular favorite is the ball scene some beautiful acting and directing here and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long cut two shots i can think of exactly which ones and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie gosh i just realize by reading the imdb listings that i ve seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him seems he s got a lot more going for him as an actor than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob hmm guess i need to pay my video store a visit lovely movie my favorite jane austen adaptation so far though perhaps ang lee s sense and sensibility is strictly speaking the better movie this one is closest to my heart and i ve certainly seen it many more times watch it if you can and don t be too hard on its little imperfections 
this is a good adaptation of austen s novel good but not brilliant the cinematography is inventive crossing at times the border to gimmickry but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes given that the entire story is dialogue driven the acting is competent ms paltrow is aloof as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match making endeavours some of the supporting cast is guilty of over acting very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures personally i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton to no fault of his own except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley dolly in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level 
emma is a true romance if you love the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly you will love this movie its true to the novel which is very important with a few twists added for pleasure gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to jeremy northam as the hero how shocked are you i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck what the right role can do for you he looks so good as the sensible regal mr k that i am literally looking at him in a new light he makes and excellent romantic lead the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful ewan mcgregor greta sacchi brings in the rest a good cast a good movie if you are a fan of jane austen see this movie along with pride and prejudice and most importantly buy the books it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
jane austen would definitely approve of this one gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma she is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant she puts on a very convincing british accent not being british myself maybe i m not the best judge but she fooled me she was also excellent in sliding doors i sometimes forget she s american also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law emma thompson s sister and mother as the bates women they nearly steal the show and ms law doesn t even have any lines highly recommended 
i have no idea how a texan the director douglas mcgrath and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms paltrow was in the first place i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar winning shakespeare in love performance but she gets all the beats right here she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this of course she s surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette greta scacchi juliette stevenson et al jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on ewan s hair is a little easier to take than it was in and personally i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays but the standout is without a doubt sophie thompson sister of emma thompson daughter of phyllida law as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn the film is worth watching again even for her performance alone all in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system well worth a rental because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again but we ll always have emma 
romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing `emma based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role a self appointed matchmaker emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend harriet toni collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying meanwhile her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr knightley jeremy northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma s and lend some needed balance to the proceedings and emma so concerned with what is right for others neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own the world goes round and love abounds but emma is about to miss the boat luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings now if she can but stop long enough to realize it but as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma she must first recognize it and seize the moment mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world there may be an air of frivolity about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone love and with mcgrath s impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable it s a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place it s light fare but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow the winsome paltrow who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre she personifies all things british and does it with such naturalness and facility that it s the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether she s simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of audrey hepburn yet paltrow is unique as an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as `hard eight `hush and `a perfect murder that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own but it s with characters like emma that she really shines she is so expressive and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing and for emma she is absolutely perfect jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley and like paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl in which he played an italian prince was less than satisfying here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real like colin firth s mr darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice northam has created a memorable character with his own mr knightley also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette as emma s friend harriet smith and alan cumming as the reverend elton respectively collette and cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genre the supporting cast includes greta scacchi mrs weston denys hawthorne mr woodhouse sophie thompson miss bates kathleen byron mrs goddard phyllida law mrs bates polly walker jane fairfax and ewan mcgregor frank churchill an uplifting elegant film `emma is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness and even if it s only through the magic of the silver screen it s nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit and that s the magic of the movies i rate this one 
this is one of the best films i have seen in years i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan but she is excellent as emma woodhouse alan cumming is superb as reverand elton and emma thompson s sister sophie is hysterical as miss bates and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr knightley what a gentleman whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma i think that is what separates it from so many others it s classy if you re looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family or looking for a romance for yourself look no further emma is that movie with a beautiful setting wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam emma is a perfect ten 
i was so impressed with doug mcgrath s film version of the jane austen novel emma and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re united for nicholas nickleby i immediately rented it without any other consideration i have read the book and for those overly critical fans of this jane austen adaptation i don t know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen s work especially given the limitations of a two hour movie which some have complained about being too long and as far as gwen paltrow s accent is concerned i must confess i wasn t too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside the film s beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker then perhaps you should rent something like death wish iii the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex violence or even a villainous antagonist the story is often amusing endearing and at times quite touching i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite 
by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays miss bates are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real find is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film northam s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar
a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association wla of kumba in southwest cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence in this muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children after years of failed efforts leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa a state prosecutor and beatrice ntuba a senior judge court president both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though i imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film two cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case another involves forced sex upon a year old girl and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age by an aunt one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and or fines the divorce is granted the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated this is a highly important and well made film of interest is the fact that one of the directors ms longinotto also co directed the film divorce iranian style which dealt with related themes in tehran in broken english with english subtitles my grade b 
what a delightful film accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel portman s lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year incredible casting gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as harriett smith the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter hind of pork pork mother she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother mrs bates played by emma thompson s mother phyllida law who looks forlorn and lost the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one s heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over over the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life s greatest lessons about how one should marry one s best friend i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself i adored it 
i love this movie my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won t this movie is definitely on my top list of good movies do you really think nothing is bouncy 
make the world go away get it off my shoulder say the things you used to say and make the world go away well dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller were in a pickle one for embezzlement and the other for kissing a child neither was guilty but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down they ended up in well nothing the whole world except for their house went away it is kind of weird but funny too just what would you do if you were all alone in the world the two friends just enjoy each other s company and do what they want but that gets old fast it seems then they start to improve their live by hating away memories the sound effects during this were great things really got weird at the end this film was the product of a great imagination and written and directed by vincenzo natali with help from the two stars it just has to be seen 
i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film i ve not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this they really work well together this film may not appeal to some people i can t really say why without spoiling it but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend it the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it although there are really only main characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch 
whether it s a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think it remembers me of i love huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond in a merry sadistic masochist way i hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarte la cr me like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematography the color of cube was black nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly than the former films of natali 
the only word that sums up this movie is quirky it s a light hearted romp through an existential concept bouncy in more way than one and a bit nutty i wouldn t exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn t seem quite as memorable as the director s first movie cube but it s a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that s how it was to be written done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension a little like the matrix meets head meets human nature out of ten
yes i m going with the on this and here s why in the last few years i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget then i stumble upon nothing looked interesting wasn t expecting much though i was wrong this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke i don t want to remark on any of the actual scenes because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies you know like killer military jets and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics this movie will make you happy to say it s ok to laugh at nothing 
this movie was very funny i couldn t stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of days the movie is distinctively unique in it s humor and visuals both are terrific and on par with natali s other more serious movie gems cube and cypher i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he s made is very interesting very likable about this movie are the music and loser characters dave and andrew portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller co writer of the story actors i both like very much also cool are the x box dead or alive fights you even see dave playing halo at a point and andrew s amazing guitar solo among many other things all in all a great feel good film about friendship you have to see this 
i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the look out for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and i ve been trying to support my country s movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships without working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges we can t be dead we have cable what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour 
this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you don t like intelligent movies it s about two guys that wish that the world would go away and that s exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not predictable and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger i actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits trust me on this one enjoy the movie 
sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating divorce iranian style which was as exactly as it stated as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran now they ve turned their attention to the court system in cameroon africa what s great about this court is that of the magistrates are women which is unusual for such a country like this anyways they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society with divorce legal and women s rights being recognized so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury and who said that justice isn t served anymore with these behind the bench they often carry out maximum penalties ya you go girl 
i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine i ll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge 
actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut the gothic horror frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the u s open where a young american caddy rises from his humble background to play against his bristish idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played i m no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man but some how this film was enthralling all the same the film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of hbo s carnivale and rome but lumbers along slowly for its first by the numbers hour once the action moves to the u s open things pick up very well paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes i loved the rain soaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings there s some compelling character development when the british harry vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players heads under pressure golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the twentieth century you know how this is going to end not only because it s based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience 
as a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport s history i was pleased with disney s sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century the movie depicted well the psychological battles that harry vardon fought within himself from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society likewise the young ouimet goes through his own class struggles being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing what i loved best however is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of ouimet s parents his father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class his mother however recognizes her son s talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior finally the golf scenes are well photographed although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament the little liberties taken by disney do not detract from the beauty of the film there s one little disney moment at the pool table otherwise the viewer does not really think disney the ending as in miracle is not some disney creation but one that only human history could have written 
i saw this film in a sneak preview and it is delightful the cinematography is unusually creative the acting is good and the story is fabulous if this movie does not do well it won t be because it doesn t deserve to before this film i didn t realize how charming shia lebouf could be he does a marvelous self contained job as the lead there s something incredibly sweet about him and it makes the movie even better the other actors do a good job as well and the film contains moments of really high suspense more than one might expect from a movie about golf sports movies are a dime a dozen but this one stands out this is one i d recommend to anyone 
bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds the acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie 
i saw this film on september st in indianapolis i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award a truly moving picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life heartland gave that award to this film this is a story of golf in the early part of the th century at that time it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs with this backdrop this based on a true story unfolds with a young working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world harry vardon and the story is inspirational against all odds francis ouimet played by shia labeouf of holes gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the u s and great britain at the u s open francis is ill prepared and has a child for a caddy the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in but despite these handicaps francis displays courage spirit heroism and humility at this world class event and we learn a lot about the early years of golf for example the use of small wooden clubs the layout of the short holes the manual scoreboard the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing and with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of miracle and remember the titans fyi there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back years 
maybe i m reading into this too much but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film i mean when a story is told casting the main character as himself i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing documenting etc and that would make it a little biased but his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongsheng s life i think the best view would have been told from hongsheng s family and friends perspectives they saw his transformation and weren t so messed up on drugs that they remember everything as for hongsheng being full of himself the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life metaphorically of course he s obviously still alive as he was cast as himself for his family s happiness huh the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex he lies on the grass coming down from during a high by himself and with his father he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms his head cocked to the side it s fabulous that he s off of drugs now but he s no hero he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle this same device is used in ted demme s blow where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero however quitting zuotian is a film that is recommended mostly for its haunting soundtrack superb acting and landscapes but the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play it makes the viewer feel as if hongsheng s life was merely a play told in many difficult parts 
i felt this film did have many good qualities the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly of course they are playing themselves but definitely unique the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use i found the jia hongsheng story interesting on a down note the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early s even though this was made in so it s really cheesy sometimes the beatles crap etc whatever not a top ten or twenty but if it s on the television check it out 
this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it s like they re almost living the past over again jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most there s moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job however this movie is not for everyone many people who suffer from depression will understand hongsheng s problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself others might see the movie as boring because it s just so real that its almost like a documentary overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad 
 quitting may be as much about exiting a pre ordained identity as about drug withdrawal as a rural guy coming to beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim but what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director zhang yang and his actors bring to this journey no clich s no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims hongshen jia is in his mid twenties he s a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved the perfect recipe for his enablers soon he s the cool actor idolized by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most fashionable he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf his acting means the arts friends and roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input and his self criticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational self doubt self hatred i didn t know how to act i felt like a phony and to readily available drugs to counter them he says i had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity hongshen s disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittent and doggedly his own solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy the abstract is out and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and high rises of beijing the physicality is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to ritan park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain grassy picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific he drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer s positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in a current circumstance if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and tv and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist but he s the only viable guide he knows he even imagines himself as john s son yoko ono and adopts his mother mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the park hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of lennon s influence as showing me a new way in the mental institute the life saving apples resistance nourishment reflect lennon s presence as does hongshen s need to re hang his hero s poster in his redecorated room if lennon s influence is spiriting hongshen s father s influence is grounding although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is fegsen s differences from his son that underwrites his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that he s chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions it s this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans beatles and passivity in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts i acted before were bullshit life is bullshit and to hongshen s emphatic you are not my father he softly replies why can t a peasant be your father under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to a real not whole self as the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust integrity banishes his black cloud all his edges soften you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap down incurred for refusing medicine back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back to back fence scene with his musician buddy hongshen says of this movie it s a good chance to think about my life and i might add become a new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity 
i loved this movie from beginning to end i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love skateboarding drawing but my friends were always there for me music was like my rehab life support and my drug it changed my life i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say this movie left me speechless to be honest i just saw it on the ifc channel i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don t do a very good job on translating lines i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess i almost never got to see this amazing movie good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed well earlier than usual lol i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film i give it three thumbs way up this movie blew me away 
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards 
i first saw this movie on ifc which is a great network by the way to see underground films i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn t hold water but it really was a worth while watch the main character is in such rough shape and you hate to see him deny help but no matter what you just can t hate him his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels the atmosphere of the film is also great at times you feel like you can see what he sees feel what he feels in some situations this movie does not leave you wanting to know more or disliking a loophole in the plot there are no loopholes in my opinion i have always been a fan of foreign films especially now with movies being made so poorly in america i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture this movie did all those things to me and more please watch this movie and if you re new to foreign films this is a great start 
i must say every time i see this movie i am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of hongsheng s life but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction it is also true that getting addicted to anything such as drugs alcohol or pornography cannot only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world your family since family is the priority in the asian culture it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him her this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy not for the fun of it but the elements surrounding it superb acting touching story great direction make this movie worth watching what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b movie actor trying to imitate the real person it shows the genuineness of the movie 
my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him spoiler plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real a must see for someone in the mental health profession 
i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting the story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on actual facts moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play not only do they all happen to be good actors jia hongsheng s parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well the film has a heavy feel but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation 
 night of the hunted stars french porn star brigitte lahaie in fact many of the cast members in this slow moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming this film is certainly different than rollin s usual lesbian vampire flicks but it s not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascination lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can t remember who she is or where she came from most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that s treating a number of people with a similar condition anyway she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held on a highway outside of town she meets a young man who stops and picks her up night of the hunted offers plenty of nudity unfortunately the pace is extremely slow the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well developed still night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyable give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin s works out of and that s being kind 
even if you re a fan of jean rollin s idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once there s not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the director s vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jean claude couty s atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe br jean a k a gary sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn t resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cash gathering xxx efforts most notably french f ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add she s picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent gard re driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting robert s name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to brigitte s thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding when robert leaves for work he s inevitably erased from elisabeth s feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel mhas move in on her during her protector s absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movie s strongest scenes as she s re introduced to her roommate catherine the late cath rine greiner a k a hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherine s unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup it s also catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker s compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them several rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movie s mid section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey a k a cyril val jacques gateau and elodie delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of plumey was only present in the film s rarely screened xxx version filles traquees the pivotal part of v ronique a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirelli s la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin s modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each other s outstretched hands 
i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from rollin also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous brigitte lahaie there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective there is also a sci fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldn t bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end 
i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can t remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in seems somewhat ahead of it s time out of kids 
i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin s films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio mechanical nightmarish stuff except it s in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing as they drive along it s obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesn t prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this tower block a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the no memory things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find what s going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to what s going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula rollin created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out out of 
since this cartoon was made in the old days felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today however compared to its contemporaries it s a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well that s because despite its age the cartoon is very creative and funny felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can t sell any shoes well felix needs money so he can go to hollywood so he tells the guy at the shop he ll get every shoe sold felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store in gratitude the guy gives felix however felix s owner wants to take the money and go alone so felix figures out a way to sneak along once there felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin in the end though through luck felix is discovered and offered a movie contract hurray 
despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isn t too sticky and pink because love is as a rose with thorns that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down to earth the music and lyrics of the cabaret chanson esquire songs sung b keira knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love some people may find it too much a biopic but it s mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy london gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars the independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story 
felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywood s most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast 
a gem of a cartoon from the silent era it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos will hays pays a visit as boss of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace a money making idea for felix s near bankrupt shoe salesman boss cannot be described it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem 
this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie chaplin s work that sound and color are not requirements for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the afore mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word balloons just like in the comics given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and figuratively and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended 
felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham sandwich the dramatic guy that tells felix he ll have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies he s in tears felix just looks at him like he s nuts and shrugs his shoulders the old guy tells felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to hollywood felix thinks how does he expect me to get the money in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat if it works well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that s how he gets to hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there we then witness felix s attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this minute cartoon it s amazing how much more you can get in an extra minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes crazy stuff 
while i can t say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons i would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for something for fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a continuation of the same except with a few new characters and a more insane cobra commander we still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other officers around instead the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the cgi it s overall pretty good if not a little over the top 
errol flynn s roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous and some would say infamous general custer that follows his career from his first day at west point through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn all the while butting heads with rival arthur kennedy and romancing pretty olivia de havilland some might say that flynn who delivers a great flamboyant performance as the general is basically playing himself playing custer a lavish production that should have been in technicolor well directed by raoul walsh they died with their boots on features some truly well staged battle sequences also it s a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse the previous year flynn played jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan s george custer in santa fe trail also with de havilland another action packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class 
warner brothers tampered considerably with american history in big trail director raoul walsh s first rate western they died with their boots on a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn this is one of errol flynn s signature roles and one of raoul walsh s greatest epics walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de havilland as flynn s romantic interest for the last time they appeared as a couple in seven previous films this minute black white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences humorous romantic scenes and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war indeed sheridan was a lieutenant at this point in fact the commandant was robert e lee as the earlier flynn film santa fe trail showed another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war warner brothers presented custer as a drinker probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked nevertheless these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film they died with their boots on opens with custer riding into west point military academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an african american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high ranking foreign general the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp arthur kennedy of city for conquest to take charge of him sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus taipe stanley ridges of task force who promptly runs custer out naturally the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl general phil sheridan john litel of the sons of katie elder is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming as it turns out sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled once he enrolls custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore when the american civil war erupts west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer avid as he is to get into the fight custer encounters his future wife elizabeth libby bacon olivia de havilland of santa fe trail and they pledge themselves to each other despite mr bacon gene lockhart of carousel who detests the sight of custer it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custer s friends and our hero reprimanded bacon meanwhile back in washington custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment but major taipe has him cooling his heels custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott sidney greenstreet of the maltese falcon and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custer s characteristics not only does scott see to it that taipe assigns custer to the second cavalry but also custer appropriates taipe s horse to get to his command during the battle of bull run july custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital custer receives a medal rather than a court martial when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg in pennsylvania scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph when a brigadier general cannot be found scott goads taipe into promoting the first available officer a mistake is made and custer is promoted incredulous at first custer embraces the moment and cracks stuart s advance after the war custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds eventually libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan who was in command of the army and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the th cavalry when he takes command custer finds the th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort meanwhile custer has his first run in with crazy horse anthony quinn of the guns of navarone and takes him into custody of course crazy horse escapes becomes custer s adversary and they fight once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians sharp with taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking taipe in a saloon brawl on his way to washington custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath custer sacrifices himself and his men at the little big horn in a slam bang showdown against redskins stagecoach lenser bert glennon captures both the grit and the glory the long shot of the th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular as an added premonition of custer s imminent demise libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the little big horn they died with their boots on benefits from a top notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune gary owen 
if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining it s got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that s hard to do when you consider custer s last stand at the little big horn and it s prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess there s an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it there s a lot to take in here though for the picture s two hour plus run time custer s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the major s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custer s first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadn t noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too as for flynn it s interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed j e b stuart opposite ronald reagan s depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynn s portrayal here it s more than evident but it doesn t come close to that of richard mulligan s take on the military hero in s little big man let s just say that one was a bit over the top the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one s point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer s character when he stated you take glory with you when it s your time to go 
after working on movies with director mickael curtiz the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement errol flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great raoul walsh this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography the died with their boots on is their first and best film together raoul walsh portrays the general george armstrong custer errol flynn from his debuts at west point to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn it s true the film shows a too heroic portrait of custer but that s not important what is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters who can forget california joe the great queen s own buttler with his song garryowen the touching mrs custer olivia de havilland the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso 
i first viewed they died with there boots on about and though it has been many years since this film and its impression remain the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable yet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well custer ranked in a graduating class of much has been made of custer s final class ranking but of the cadets who entered the military academy with him in half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day june it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident his squadron would follow him to hell your at attention sargeant reprimands tape if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attach to not only sheridan but hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellan there is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels custers audacity shone through he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers including a rebel captain yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomac this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise robert l bateman armchair general there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officer he was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the means and the information discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lee s plans to split his forces and yet he failed to act for some hours it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg pa his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some rebels with but a force of i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion there is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments though custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe the truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it 
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards 
i blame birth of a nation myself for commencing the long running tradition of hollywood travesties of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of custer and his th cavalry crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition try custer and his wife s learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory custer s testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all custer s storming into the president s office to beg to return to his post honestly there s plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness and yet and yet it s still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever dehavilland as beguiling as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth here i think we re closer to the legend of the legend but hey it s only a movie and a rollicking wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that 
being warner brothers second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn general george armstrong custer they died with their boots on warner brothers was the far more accurate of the two especially when contrasted with santa fe trail warner brothers which really didn t set the bar very high although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn there was a change in the casting the part of general custer whereas it was dutch himself ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant egomaniacal cavalryman in the earlier picture with mr flynn playing virginian and later confederate hero general j e b or jeb stuart errol took on the custer part for they died with their boots on once again the warner brothers propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the warner s repertory company are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity and all is really happening right before our very own eyes major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses such as elizabeth bacon mrs custer co star olivia de havilland ned sharpe arthur kennedy samuel bacon gene lockhart chief crazy horse anthony quinn californy charlie grapwin major taipe stanley ridges general phillip sheridan john litel callie the bacon s maid hattie mcdaniel the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited though skilled players such as joe sawyer eleanor parker minor watson tod andrews irving bacon roy barcroft lane chandler spencer charters frank ferguson francis ford william forrest george eldridge russell hicks william hopper hoppity hooper eddie keane fred kelsey sam mcdaniel patrick mcvey frank orth eddie parker addison richards ray teal jim thorpe all american himself minerva urecal dick wessel gig young and many many more the film moves very quickly particularly in the early goings then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years the assignment of custer as a colonel in the th cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn in montana under the guidance of director griffith veteran raoul walsh the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions from the very serious exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos as with most any of mr walsh s films he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy farce actually as previously mentioned this is much more factual than its predecessor santa fe trail last time we ll mention it honest schultz scout s honor however that is not to say that it wasn t without a few little bits of artistic and literary license as indeed just about any biopic will have it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of literary license is that business about custer s being accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general it just didn t happen that way yet the gag both helped the film to move along while it underscored the whole light carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film director walsh and mr flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident being the massacre by the lakota sioux the cheyenne and the fukowi of custer and his th cavalry at the little big horn at the time of its occurrence june custer s last stand was as big an incident and shock to the americans national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor december or the atrocities perpetrated by the islamic fascists to new york s twin trade towers and the united states armed forces headquarters in the pentagon arlington virginia on september just as so many films of that period of world war ii and the years immediately before there were so many incidents in it that were if not intentionally done were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period poodle schnitz 
when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland they died with their boots on is most likely the film remembered best it is the sweeping saga of general custer flynn told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon dehavilland through his tenure during the american civil war and finally with his death at little big horn director raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts rewritten by screen writers wally kline and aeneas mackenzie until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion hence the battle against chief crazy horse anthony quinn is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians california joe charley grapewin and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nation s first peoples flynn who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold schwartzenegger to two parts albert schweitzer has never been more ignoble he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine resident warner stock players arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them overall then despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn they died with their boots on is ample film fodder for a saturday matin e or sunday night cooing with one s sweetheart warner s dvd is pretty nice looking although film grain is often obvious the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep solid blacks and very clean whites some fading is obvious during scene transitions the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level 
the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful arthur kennedy never more villainous anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little big horn the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight however i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywood s golden age 
it s true that they died with their boots on gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer s errol flynn life and career but a remarkable one especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn because it is not a given that a movie tries to portray both the us american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse anthony quinn in a favorable light i m almost tempted to say that little big man in its unqualified anti custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison further one should not be mislead by the title of the picture this isn t just a movie about the battle of the little big horn it s a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet the famed civil war hero the indian fighter and last but not least the husband the movie begins with custer s time at the west point military academy where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits during a punitive military exercise he meets his future wife elizabeth bacon olivia de havilland who like custer himself is a native of monroe michigan custer intends to court her but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away custer s legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg while on leave he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth who promises him her hand in matrimony immediately after the war custer and elizabeth bacon are married with the civil war over custer is demoted doesn t get a real command and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small professional american army as he starts to drink his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general in chief winfield scott custer is given the command of the us th cavalry which he trains to be an elite unit neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horse s cause but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle they died with their boots on though short on historical accuracy is as good as war movies and westerns in the s got both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming the only minus and that s why i can t give this picture a full is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants elizabeth s servant callie is the stereotypical overweight good natured superstitious black mammy it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans just a couple of years later the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers needless to say that they died with their boots on omits the fact that custer s overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart and doesn t mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn nevertheless custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station gettysburg trevilian station and others though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggests in any event they died with their boots on is a well made war movie with western elements three outstanding performers flynn quinn and de havilland and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money which wouldn t be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come it would deserve a if it weren t for the racist minstrelization of african americans 
the film is excellent one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynn s performance is superb this is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn the cold calculating look on flynn s face as he does so is extraordinary much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p huntley jr as lt queen s own butler it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor 
now this is more like it one of the best movies i have ever seen despite it made very well on all aspects this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate loosen up there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand how entertaining and how captivating this movie was now this is what a movie ticket is all about you will get exacty what you want from this movie s genre and all naysayers are those with the anti flynn syndrome this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti elvis anti ali anti clinton anti kennedy syndromes usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best movies of all time i rate it the second best western ever right behind wayne s the cowboys 
this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custer s life and his last stand do not rent `they died with their boots on but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch the story starts out with custer s errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havilland errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of callie played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laugh the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the director s portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him i give it a thumbs up for this western film 
naturally along with everyone else i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the custer story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clich s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early th century for instance even while this film attempted to whitewash it s hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real life custer his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to custer s cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid custer s promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i half expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene custer s stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky custer s drinking problem is certainly not ignored and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy co as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didn t expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the th cavalry and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk 
as a history of custer this insn t even close custer dies to help the indians i am sure the other members of the th cav weren t consulted in that decision but as a western this is fun flynn looks and acts the part of the dashing cavalier and the garry owen is always nice to hear 
so keira knightly is in it so automatically we compare this film to attonement aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning these films are totally different the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche s damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly ind yourself moved go on give it a go 
although they died with their boots on is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western not only is flynn the perfect custer the character actors are superb besides the action portion of the movie flynn and dehavilland s love scenes are very touching and believable flynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well 
errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west fighting military red tape confederates indians and carpetbagger business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end not to forget the ever reliable o de havilland as lady mary of the west never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons it doesn t work out just enjoy it because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when raoul walsh and errol flynn co worked 
the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky dashing irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism it was robin hood all over again and flynn blossomed in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing and this one was no exception it also benefits from the return of former co star olivia de havilland despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership the part of strong minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynn s later films and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a romping adventure movie and the screen chemistry is rekindled for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effect the flynn de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film s durability when most of flynn s other westerns held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly cursory despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out schoolboy fashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but it s a trifle too morally convenient however these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players memorably including anthony quinn in an all but wordless role as the sioux leader errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal charmingly sheepish looks unexpected sweetness mischievous twinkles flash point indignation cheerful fellowship and sheer high octane charisma he s a reckless braggart but you can t help but like him and it s hard to go away without the tune of garryowen threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter this is one of flynn s lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered 
this is awesome there is no partnership quite like errol and olivia there love is genuine i m yet this flick is as captivating now as i m sure it was years ago raoul walsh is an under rated genius his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between colonel custer flynn and his wife de havilland almost brought me to tears not easy for a yr old guy its so heart wrenching there is also a deep christian message implicit here the faith custer has in taking your glory with you and the trust and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this a must see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american and military history from the inside patriotic for all the right reasons i knew errol flynn was a star and de havilland was a screen legend this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest 
george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general custer in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments in spite of his poor standing he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error custer receives a promotion in rank before this can be corrected he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero custer returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart libby who is played by olivia de havilland libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a treaty with crazy horse the leader of the sioux when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de havilland s depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining the reviewer would rate this a star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land 
whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the th century libby and george were married for years until the little big horn what s not known to today s audience is that libby survived until during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby s point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late while custer was still at west point i m not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby s farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia s especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don t moisten you are made of marble as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can t beat this film at all 
great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color wow 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although i ve heard that the film isn t very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn t until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was i ll give this film out of 
although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best 
this is a wonderful film as a film it gets an out of as a filmed piece of accurate history one wishes to be more loving but it is a out of and i think i am actually being very charitable what was he like that man of horse and saber who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes opinionated militant bumptious bloody handed ambitious clever too clever indian foe indian friend and national hero his death in was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington lincoln jackson and grant lee and sherman jackson it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career the overly ambitious hot spur that his reputation declined yet to this day george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our history s military annals to lose his last battle i can t really think of a similar one maybe general jonathan mayhew wainwright forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march but wainwright survived the march and the second world war custer has appeared in more films than far better generals due to the western adventures and little big horn pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film but even in the legend was still potent olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth john ford would have fully understood this and approved it so we get the view that he was a hot spur but he was patriotic although almost pushed out of west point by demerits which was true custer was in the class of and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year you see most of the so called military talent from west point from robert e lee down was southern and joined the confederacy the union needed every northern point man they could find custer s civil war career should be given closer study he was attached to the staff of general in chief george b mcclellan and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare but he was a cavalryman and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and sherman s buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek which ended the threat of the confederacy in the shenandoah valley it also hit custer hard on a personal level his close west point friend stephen ramseur joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer mortally wounded custer sat with ramseur all through the latter s last night alive following the war things fell apart he wanted to make his brevet major generalship permanent it wasn t as it was a battlefield promotion they only had a lt colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier he tried to play politics making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot he supposedly admired the indians he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west but he caused a genuine military massacre in of indian women and children that ended with a court martial later during the s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians that went up to the secretary of war william belknap who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit it ruined belknap and left a black eye on the grant administration it put him into the doghouse with grant and sherman who was belknap s former commander and sheridan barely saved his career then he was sent on the final big horn campaign and immortality arrived that career is worth a real film but would it be too critical should we hold a man of the s to the standards of would we like that done to us in a hundred years certainly it could happen but i m not sure we d like it custer style fit flynn like a glove with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero s character in support actors like sidney greenstreet stanley ridges arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends foes or even treacherous sneaks kennedy as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be 
can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to extend everyone s knowledge of himself and the world around him bob dylan named himself after him so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer sharman macdonald has taken a different better approach in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who lusts and loves to the full wife caitlin sienna miller his feisty support war hero william cillian murphy who saves him from a street brawl and then there s his childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera she s caitlin s closest friend william s wife and like a muse the star in dylan s dark sky it all kicks off in the london blitz with bomb shelters in the underground enter vera an impressive keira knightley under makeshift stage spotlights she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is flushed their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the purity of their former passion dylan native welsh speaker matthew rhys is no sanctified sanitised poet master of his vices he must experience them all fully he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story it s pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson granddaughter of the real william and vera think of all the things that you don t want me to write about she said because i have to have carte blanche for macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan s memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her children s interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth in the hours in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film the film s colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting vera s lit up in lights stage persona we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan but vera s lipstick red brightness is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to poetry s juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day constant echoes of dylan s poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things i ll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere caitlin recalls childhood with vera we re still innocent in dylan she says there s a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year 
the custer legend a la warner brothers epic there s no casting against type here with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute not only to custer but to the men of the th cavalry the story traces the life of the famed boy general from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates but this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood down beat ending and all this is great fun 
all in all an excellent movie from that time and source coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii provided you don t take it at all seriously the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say jfk this one may actually be more honest about it though as it essentially admits along the way that it s not to be taken as particularly fact based but more of a stylishly semi heroic portrayal it s worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today the ny times review conceded that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film described the biographical account of custer s life as fanciful and pointed out that the presentation of custer s motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts they could have really gone overboard in building up custer one supposes but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around but appropriately determined principled and inspirational flynn and dehavilland doing their th movie together in years and their last are so comfortable together and play off each other so easily at this point that it s not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here with a first time pairing it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer but these two make it work the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together the greatly underrated michael curtiz but given that he had worked with them on the previous year s similar themed santa fe trail it s understandable if he chose to opt out of this one they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade both terrific so we can t really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh raoul walsh the director here is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences which are outstanding and everything else outdoors the interior scenes are a little more uneven but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well as does warner bros outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces greenstreet gene lockhart anthony quinn arthur kennedy etc i would have liked it better if kennedy s character had been a bit less standard i generally like his work but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene the part could have been better written and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle as he d only been in films for one year walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together various highlights include the depiction probably imagined of the genesis of garryowen as the cavalry theme the last half hour is particularly outstanding especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventure of 
dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer the dashing jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless headstrong cadet through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians olivia de havilland flynn s co star in several other films scores as the devoted adoring libby bacon and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse the film s battle scenes are excellent the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers hammers the confederate army into submission custer s last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle a savage clash between red men and white with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men great direction cinematography casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic 
i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins louden s perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the s i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonna s character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie pure beauty and genius 
nicole finn madonna is just being released from prison although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record louden griffin dunne is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law louden will be driving around the city anyway in his future mother in law s rolls royce picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector nicki however starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving between big cats taxi drivers hit men bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns lawyer louden knows he s not in kansas anymore is there a way out of the madness this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue madonna and dunneare perfect foils to each other making their connection uproarious as they play out their roles as an ex con and an uptight button down lawyer respectively the script is laudable in it s ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one and the next everything secondary from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes are also quite nice if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy rent this movie for them you will both be cheerio pronto 
i have to rate this movie at a i m sorry but i think it s classic comedy then if you re rating it to other madonna movies well what you wanna tell me it wasn t her best movie ever didn t mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later please this movie deserves much more credit than it gets plus i like to think of it as an a sociological study into the lifestyles of the s remember when you could shoplift from sam goody and cartier in the same day remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly so it was no last emperor it was still good there are certain movies i d be willing to watch everyday three actually that pep up my day and make me smile if you like who s that girl then i d also recommend party girl and romy and michelle s high school reunion 
i haven t been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this film this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was panned by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn t give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the film griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came years before the roberts gere success it s a goof ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor i know this doesn t tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun peace gary
nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much peroxide lipstick and eyebrows only madonna could get away with that but that s why i love nikki finn she s not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she doesn t rob or murder unless you re out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed she knows what to take and what can t be stolen if you need a favor from her she s in bottom line she knows how to enjoy life nikki is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her who s that girl she s the girl for me 
when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but who s that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless it s a campy sort of film that s a joy to watch there s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts i ve watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn t the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight 
why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down it is cute and funny exactly what it is meant to be madonna wasn t out to prove herself as an oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow she was just doing what the character called for and she did it well i loved her in this movie it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita the soundtrack is excellent too it is no better or no worse than any cheesy s flick to all the critics just don t take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it madonna is a goddess 
in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life the highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer not content with this forever jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people how many people will be interested in a loner something who s best friend is a cat after several failed attempts at getting a girl including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david brents fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office disco s dead says jon he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself naturally they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat fortunately jon s new girlfriend is allergic to cats with slicker animation than past tv specials this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends 
this movie is so good i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im now plus the acting was great and madonna is my idol and she did a phat job alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why 
one of the funniest most romantic and most musical movies ever definitely worth renting buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography the animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie a definite must for madonna fans o 
for late s cheese this really isn t so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand theft thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for razzies as well as oscars i m curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper bronxy accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after who s that girl
fantastic madonna at her finest the film is funny and her acting is brilliant it may have been made in the s but it has all the qualities of a modern hollywood block buster i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes fantastic 
i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 
if this film had been made in the s or s critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end it s not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs ritchie s acting in the film not the best on the planet but it adds to the film s unique slapstick comedy aspirations and showcases madonna s often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays nikki finn an ex convict who was framed for a crime she didn t commit griffin dunne plays the hapless future groom puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there is one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is 
madonna gets into action again and she fails again who s that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people don t want that she s successful both as a pop star and a movie star the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title track single was agreat hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth isthat madonna failed as an actress cause the script was quite weak butit s not so bad especially for those who like the s it s such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie at the end it s very funny to watch it 
i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it i also like madonna s character and i do not agree that she played herself she has created a character and a sympathetic one my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love the humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybody s cup of tea but it s their problem not of the film i found this film wholesome and sunny in fact the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day and madonna can act just take off your glasses of negative thinking 
 what s his name loudon loudon what clear that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was released i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue madonna plays nikki finn a young woman jailed for a crime she didn t commit when she gets out she decides to seek revenge griffin dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his fianc e s father john mcmartin the future father in law asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications aplenty some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only but on the other hand i can t imagine her doing it in her normal voice this film shows madonna s comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fianc e yes it s predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it times more 
i love this movie sure i love it because of madonna but who cares it s damn funny alanis rocks when i first saw this film in the theatres back in i thought it was all out hilarious madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky funky look the all time funniest part is when madonna nikki screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi and also when griffin dunne louden trips and falls at the apartment interview scene alanis rocks madonna s character nikki steals shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time didn t rob nothin when you rob a store you stick up the cashier we busted a few tapes there s a bit of a difference i love that it s classic alanis rocks i don t know why this movie got slammed the way it did i see nothing wrong with it course maybe if you re a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome anyone out there who wants to see some funny classic entertainment then watch who s that girl and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist alanis will always rock ya completely to the end so does madonna in this film and just entirely her acting is superb

i kid you not yes who s that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonna s films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonna s character is relegated to being second fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in wtg madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonna s best and one of her most underrated films madonna plays nikki finn an ex con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn t commit she s being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays louden trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together that s when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy louden s rolls royce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunne s stuck up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jake s girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny that s how some of the best comedy should be played straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies it s still a fun screwball comedy of the s not for everyone i m sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it interesting note one of madonna s friends from her early s new york club days coati mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band 
if you like madonna or not this movie is hilarious i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release however over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun sure there are some bad lines cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast she is cute funny and is the only comedic role of her movie career madonna usually just plays herself in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film she really seems like somebody else for once of course the film is directed by james foley who filmed the dramatic and haunting at close range with sean penn christopher walken and co stars griffin dunn after hours who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material the story is nothing genius and don t expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun clean s romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see the soundtrack is also very notable and contains madonna songs the hit who s that girl the hit causing a commotion and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads the look of love top hit in the uk and can t stop a left over pop ditty from the true blue sessions the year before it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd 
so madonna isn t meryl streep still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that give her a break sure the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w katherine hepburn bringing up baby for what it is though a piece of fluff it s quite a bit of fun to watch i ve yet to hear anyone that slams madonna s acting skills back it up w evidence or even adjectives other than awful bad or other such vague descriptive words if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about whitney houston she s had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn t act her way out of a hatbox the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies get real people madonna bashing is so s 
i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc at the ziegfield at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now she had a couple of hits was very good in desparately seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium who s that girl gives madonna an actual role to play which is not just a variation of her own personality she does the madcap heroine routine better than you might think griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans the story involves a huge cat named murray a bride to be who has slept with every cabbie in nyc a mean father in law and a key there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path all the elements of a screwball comedy intact sir john mills is seen briefly he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side complete with a rain forest and everything compared to most madonna movies the ones i ve been able to tolerate anyway this is fantastic on its own its not that bad ps the concert was lousy 
watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine it s sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure it s the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation he s very good in a small role as bracco s pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie 
i loved this movie you can t buy it rent it or find it but it s a keeper wonderful chemistry between braccho and walken and ferrar terrific non stop action and reactions loved it i ve watched my pirated copy maybe times in the last decade each time showing it to someone who never heard of it find this movie and watch it so many films are on tv over and over again without any of the wit and style of this little film i didn t know it was made for tv my copy is an track i pirated years ago i hope it lasts 
a quite easy to watch tale of thieves with that love hate type relationship between them chrisopher walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than he s letting on 
it s strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you ve seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i ve ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful you ll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a run n coke i know i did i m very glad i saw this movie it was just too nice to miss 
finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed s machomovie on a upn affiliate s midday saturday program would be misleading it deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads best attributes to its maximum advantage bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre do the streetwise troubled minds routine that they are so good at portraying for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la fuqua s training day dive back into the world of early s tv movies to find scam 
i am a huge fan of harald zwart and i just knew that i had to see this movie even though i can t say i m a soccer fan but watching this just filled my heart with joy and i had a great time in the movies watching it bj rn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year if you re only gonna see one norwegian movie this year this is the one 
this was a great movie it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy so what makes a movie great technical details i think that if that were the sole criteria our culture would be the poorer for it so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to mozart the point is it is one of the best movies of it s type i ve seen the women are all beautiful as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made it has a little of everything a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets wayne s world there is plenty of charm and a reasonable albeit predictable storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen joe estevez may not have his brothers career but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in was that intentional if you re attracted to the box rent the video you won t regret it as is promised it is good non violent erotic fun 
is this a bad movie of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or schindler s list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure adolescent fun there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so unashamedly i say again if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it 
i`ve seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in it`s unrated version which is soft core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by b queen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series 
this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that s partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you ll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time don t be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it s more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond 
we open in a doctors room of some sort a girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor he asks her questions silence follows he continues to ask questions ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere the story is about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an incident that happened before hand they are greeted on their arrival by their trying way too hard to be nice but so totally evil stepmother who the girls obviously hold resentment for as time goes on at home the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls and to top it all off there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls recovery this film is amazing it has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming it almost makes you cry at some points i know i had a teary moment of two specifically the cupboard scene but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits the soundtrack is faultless the furnishings in the house and the use of colour are fantastic a pure joy for the eyes this is a definite must see for all asian movie fanatics or any sort of movie fan an easy 
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it s so full of details and every time you see it you ll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they can t do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there aren t i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skit so the machinist secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them 
 tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i ve seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father s home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she s prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you ve seen it s a hell of a puzzler 
another asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well major spoiler warning the movie starts pretty simple two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother especially the elder one and they seem to ignore their father all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn t know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister revealed when the stepmother actually the sister s alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there finally my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack very creepy out of 
what can i say about this film that won t give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused if you ve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you ll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on i m not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and don t mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl 
disgused as an asian horror a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family i was really surprised at the depth of this movie director ji woon kim s decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies a tale of two sisters tels the story as it s name suggest of two sisters su mi and the younger su yeon who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother s gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience so i ll just leave it at that the plot is very tightly written with the characters nicely fleshed out ji woon kim s focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character from the protective su mi the weaker su yeon the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother s frantic and later deadly behavior there is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it the actors superbly fit their roles it is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat ji woon kim s direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the film s horroresque scenes while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film a tale of two sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride with it s strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better 
this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away norway is known for making crappy movies no offense but i had a good feeling about this one even thou i m not interested in football i wanted see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if you re ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one 
typically a movie can have factors like arousing good feel sense of purpose plot etc there s always something that can be taken out of movies its just a matter of how compelling the reason is for me to own it in my collection tale of two sisters as they call it when it was released in my country has tremendous feel and an eventually mostly self explaining plot i love horror movies that revolve around a house titles that come to mind are the others the haunting the haunting of hell house this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the movie had extremely rich colour in the way the house was decorated in the clothes that the characters wore in the open skied daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies which typically makes use of desaturated tones and gloomy environs think honogurai mizu no soko kara dark water which is another show i like that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it wasn t in its more gripping moments the characters are extremely believable this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse the director toys with timelines in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion this is a positive aspect of this film in my opinion and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable i would definitely look out for this on dvd 
i must say i m an avid horror movie fan and currently i can t get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gore this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m night s sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isn t too much i ve never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that it s great 
the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you haven t seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the end don t forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldn t help stick on my seat till the end conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood don t miss it 
if you consider yourself a horror movie fan chances are you ve seen hideo nakata s ring and dark water they re superb and ring s making its way smoothly into hollywood maybe dark water will be adapted soon too while ring is almost pure heart pounding and nerve breaking a tale of two sister is both nerve breaking and mind twisting along with the other i consider this korean flick a brilliant and smart ending horror movie the only flaw this movie has is some consider its first minutes rather slow it s actually typical with korean and japanese movies i consider it carefully planned rather than slow think of it as calm moment before the storm with thorough introduction of characters imho viewer will get involved more intimately with the character one of korean and japanese movies strongest point like ring a tale of two sister doesn t overdo ghastly appearance rather they let our mind do the intimidating job itself that way it s scarrier and horrifyingly classy at the same time i won t be surprised if hollywood remakes this movie after bringing ring and grudge ju on over this flick is not that good by the way i rate it don t miss it 
to most of us life is an unfolding process of love for others like soo mi however it is dominated by darkness and fear based on the korean folk tale jangha and hongryun kim ji woon s brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters soo mi lim su jeong and soo yeon mun geon yeong who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorian style mansion feeling alienated from the world they cling to each other for survival with the older soo mi obsessively protecting the younger soo yeon against danger for soo mi however not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother s death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality while we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings doors that open and close on their own a cruel and overbearing stepmother and other events of high strangeness a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge soo mi says do you know what s really scary you want to forget something totally wipe it off your mind but you never can it can t go away you see and and it follows you around like a ghost there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel the plot cannot be summarized only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective in the film s opening soo mi an obviously disturbed young woman is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution when the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day the film flashes back to when soo mi and soo yeon return to the home of their father moo hyeon kim kap su and stepmother eun joo yum jung ah the stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is soo mi who is really hurting as the girls try to readjust they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences soo mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone s mind we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged at least until an important clue is offered in the film s second half shot in gorgeous low light cinematography a tale of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares and there are plenty it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to while the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness in the words of a wise observer blame is never the answer whether it is blaming yourself or others rather the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely both of yourself and others forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing 
three words piece of art this film is just great it s beautiful sad frightening and thought provoking at the same time the score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good well i saw the title a tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting then i read the summary of the plot and decided you don t just watch this film you ve gotta buy it said done i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream i really didn t see something like this coming and the ending scene made me cry it just made me cry it was so sad well i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as i mentioned before a very sad one but this just fits in the mood of the film doesn t it 
if there is such a thing as beautiful horror this film is one of the best in this genre it is a horror movie which despite not being void of gore scenes relies more on psychology and masterful building of the tension in order to create thrills and it is one of those movies so beautifully filmed where each scene is a full world of symbols and details all serving the scope and genre that it can be called but beautiful it is not an easy story with two sisters returning to their father and step mother mansion after having spent some time in a psychiatric institution they cope hardly with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world of theirs defending them against the adult world so the film seems to be at its most external layer actually the film slowly evolves to something very different at slow pace but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty so i will not say much more watch it it is one of the best in the genre of far east horror films that conquered recently the world cinema and it really shows that they succeeded to do it for good reasons 
let me just say i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless except really low quality b movie horrors which i could do without and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the japanese ringu or the american ring or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror the eye previously the ring had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of the tale of two sisters any day the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you ll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the ring i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off still i am glad it didn t come back to haunt me later that sadako samara did from the ring after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling but one that hopefully won t leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special but do remember if you don t understand the plot after the first viewing a repeat viewing is more than advised i personally didn t have time for this since it was late so i flicked through scenes on the dvd some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net seemed ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful all in all a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same level remake its been purchased by dreamworks simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can its one of the best you will get unfortunately due to the type of movie this is there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did watch it without knowing a single thing except its a tale of two sisters and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time 
this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of a tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer s curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide a clear answer pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don t expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular a tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this the true fear of a tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares it is a psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called asian horror genre indeed it would be a mistake to align a tale of two sisters with films like ringu and the grudge this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints some requiring no suspension of credulity others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly whichever way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general 
every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what s going on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b bs and lots of blood if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts ch without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation and don t forget to switch the light off my points on different aspects direction acting atmosphere sound effect total 
i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen well done 
the finest short i ve ever seen some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers there s irony in that comment and little merit the acting is all up to noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly i might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect this is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty a beautiful short film fwiw i was pleased at the picasso reference since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent like i assume most people until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for 
many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian horror films a trend which has admittedly grown dull however it has produced some true classics and a tale of two sisters for me at least stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time based vaguely on a korean folktale it tells the sad story of two mentally troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes as the story takes several twists and the scares become more emotional and quite real by the end you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic one to watch again and again if only to work it all out 
this isn t so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details so i advise you not to read this review if you haven t seen the film because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original at least from a purely superficial aspect some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water while the storyline itself especially what brendt sponseller calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like fight club lead character interacts with someone created in their mind mulholland drive character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue as well as other minor aspects of lost highway jacob s ladder and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness plus amenabar s films the others abre los ojos memento particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory et al thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film s overall emotional impact and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self explanatory even if it is in part portrayed in a non sequential manner the narrative only becomes confusing for some because midway through the final third the story switches from a purely subjective setting ie soo mi s warped perception of reality to an objective one with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo mi s nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive even though we re not dealing with a character s perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies something which in turn reminded me of another lynch movie lost highway to be honest i don t really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a family s breakdown as well as an honest look at a character s mental illness and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film that aside the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i ve seen this side of wong kar wai s the performances are also fantastic without exception and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days it s very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach but then each to their own if you can ignore some of the film s platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart ie an extremely tragic heart breaking story then i see no reason not to recommend it 
i watch many movies but presently my genre number one is asian horror i have just bought this dvd and i initially found janghwa hongryeon an intriguing but confused film since i had not understood many parts of the story but i saw in imdb board a message titled explanation of a masterpiece all your questions answered faster load written by opiemar and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story i would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers in the end i agree that janghwa hongryeon is a great korean film but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once like this film demands and without the great support of opiemar i would not be able to understand the story as a whole i intend to see this movie again in a near future my vote is eight title brazil medo fear 
two sisters su mi im soo jung and su yeon moon geun young return home with their father kim gap soo eun joo yeom jeong ah welcomes them but su mi s manner is bitter to her su mi hates eun joo because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters mother died seeing her attitude eun joo is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them as if called in by the atmosphere series of mysterious things occur in the house when su mi is hanging her dress in her wardrobe there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design when she put her diary into a drawer she finds another diary of the same kind there when she is sleeping in her bed with scared su yeon a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her and a hand dangles out of the woman s skirt mysterious things occur to the other people too on the evening of next weekend eun joo s brother and his wife visit the family and they have a dinner together eun joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child but nobody is interested in her talk she says the crazy man annoyed the brother but he says he doesn t know anything about the man listening to their talk the brother s wife has a panic after the dinner the conflict between eun joo and the sisters becomes at its worst eun joo pulls su yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it su mi saves the crying out sister and complains to their father what eun joo has done to his daughter but his response is unexpected give me a break says he angrily su mi please don t make me tired any more and the following words out of the father s mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house to tell the truth i hate horror movies although i seated myself at a theater because my intuition told me the movie was something different i was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing the regret however had changed into joy for expectation ten minutes later this film is a tragic mystery more than a horror painful more than horrible beautiful more than sensational that may have a hard core horror fan disappointed but for a mystery fan like me this film is a must see out of 
i first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step mother their relationship with their step mother is strained to say the least with the step mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls the film though slants with oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing the direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the step mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film the large house adds eeriness and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat this film to me clearly shows why korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment you simply don t get anything like this in the western world sadly and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade highly recommended viewing in my opinion a real joy and scare 
i just saw a tale of two sisters last night and really enjoyed it i ve been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea there aren t many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film but the director does maintain the off kilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone s there s something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case it s the closet and the sink i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together he s also good at revealing people s inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you major spoilers ahead do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed i was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part however i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together the film is very much like the machinist in the way two of the character s joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions here s my interpretation of the film the su yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su mi or the actual ghost of su yeon that only su mi can see and interact with the initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a delusion of su mi there is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when she s wearing the gray pantsuit i believe it s the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn t appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house the stepmother before that point is imagined by su mi perhaps part of her split personality that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother s brother looks at her like she s crazy and doesn t remember anything that she recounts i think it was su mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make up in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be su mi wiping her make up in the mirror i think the ghosts in the house aren t entirely imagined by su mi and are either of su yeon or the mother or both in the final flashback it is revealed the su yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink also it s the hairpin that su yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink the real stepmother in the end gets punished by the ghost of su yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring after that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while su mi unintentionally played a supporting role i wonder if the mother that su yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet that s left ambiguous other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too it s not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself it s also suggested that the mother had mental issues too requiring a nurse the stepmother alludes to this when she tells su mi you re beginning to take after your mother i don t think she meant just physically also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually su mi then there s the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her is that why su mi freaks out and shouts don t touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes is that the filthy things that you ve done that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father this film is interesting in it s capacity for different interpretations a few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black crawling around scene which reminded me of the herky jerky movements of kayako in the ju on the grudge films also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the sixth sense or the others overall i enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake that s already in production turns out i have to be honest i liked both the ring and the grudge so i m not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can t be good too one remake that i m really excited about is dark water coming out this summer i haven t seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my to see list 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made i ll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making it s practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute quite literally ji woon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels a seemingly insignificant object may be shown a rack of dresses two diaries a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack a bottle of pills etc but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer s intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid fire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness lest they miss something important in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this it s quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions he posits that ji woon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that in reality however nothing could be further from the truth a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention he would have noticed for example the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film these flashbacks convincingly contradict zaphod s assertion of complete subjectivity the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them can ji woon kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film i think not please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot get a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture you need only put them together remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that when completed bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe don t misunderstand me there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design spider forest perfect blue and donnie darko are perfect examples of this a tale of two sisters is not it s ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence i m ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort he apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible this is evident when he makes consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself just read the threads by opiemar within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious i d like to say more but i ve come to my word limit all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said 
i love horror films but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind the devil s backbone the exorcist for example this is that kind of film and it s not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful a tale of two sisters starts really slow so if you re in a hurry to see ghosts in the first minutes you will be disappointed actually this is not a ghost story though there are some it s something more complex and it s done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat a tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you re the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie the acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl those two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film 
perhaps i m one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of asian shockers is so over hyped films like ringu or the the eye which are praised all over the world simply didn t convince me and they looked more boring than frightening well this blunt opinion doesn t go for the south korean gem a tale of two sisters this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror tale that really gets under your skin the plot based on a local folklore tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all time greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tension building surely provokes feelings of great respect this is one of those few films that are impossible to label the events in two sisters qualify as mind bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait besides a mesmerizing story a tale of two sisters also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music good acting and innovative camera work the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door several sequences like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls room are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that i ve seen my share of spooky horror a tale of two sisters is a terrific movie adventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics a little warning for people with a short attention span though this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time it s also a film that requires repeated viewing even though no one will never really get it for a full 
the beauty the terror the poetry the horror the innocence the guilt maybe that s just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it i myself didn t even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie i just took a look at the nice cover art didn t even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvd player i only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended the dvd cover read the most frightening film since the ring the grudge and dark water though the frightening part might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is a ghostly apparition with long black hair it s even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others this movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise twists and just when you think you ve had the conclusion whether you get it or not that s irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end this movie goes on a bit longer the cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night the camera work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not innovating angles some shots are pure poetry e g the top shot with the two sisters at the lake it all looks very stylish there are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense the story itself starts a bit slow but there s a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting there was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering peter jackson s heavenly creatures but when the horror kicks in it s quite effective there are also a few successful surprise scares in it damn i jumped right up from my sofa the musical score is great and at times when it s not supposed to be scary i couldn t help but noticing that it had sort of an italian feeling to it a bit strange for a korean movie but nevertheless a great score so much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround sound i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit it s more a mysterious horror drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level no matter how you look at it this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest it might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed so if you haven t seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your dvd player go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it s minutes running time there i hope i did a good job praising it without spoiling anything 
hehehe this was one of the best funny road movies ever i laughed so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves harald zwart is the producer known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool s it is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in soccer in germany and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious i couldn t stop laughing i haven t had so much fun in ages rumors say it will come a number two but i do not know it will be hard beating this one recommended to everyone it is a must see film i was suppose to see it at the cinema but i had work at the times it where shown and been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out got it today on dvd well worth it 
 a tale of two sisters is a brilliant south korean psychological horror that left me speechless the film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy the small cast of actors is truly excellent with lead im soo jung being especially memorable in the lead role the direction by kim ji woon is well handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous the plot is slightly confusing but some scenes are wonderfully eerie the action is rather slow but i was not bored in the slightest i was extremely curious and intrigued the house where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated a tale of two sisters is along with ringu and kairo one of the most original asian horror films i have ever seen watch this masterpiece as soon as possible my rating out of 
the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost horror films from the east has been dismal this film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on e bay or similar it is well photographed and the sound is superb viewing on a good screen and with a good or dts enabled sound system is recommended obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then i wouldn t bother with this dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here it is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences i would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant the ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope the plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way if i do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring we have however accepted straight copies of other peoples ideas for western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge pleasure from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic 
 a tale of two sisters or janghwa hongryeon is a true masterpiece brilliant psychological thriller heart wrenching drama and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package from the intricate plot to the beautiful cinematography to the absolutely perfect casting every aspect of this film is extraordinary for fear of revealing too much concerning the plot i will just say it is very satisfying while it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first it does a good job of explaining things in the end and whether you prefer psychological thriller drama or horror i promise you will not be disappointed from a technical standpoint its nearly flawless the set the cinematography lighting and especially the soundtrack all are captivating the waltz seemed an odd choice at first but proved to be an ingenious choice as for the casting we re talking absolute perfection i m su jeong is totally convincing as the defiant yet troubled su mi mun keun yeong is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister su yeon these two girls were magical on the screen i will certainly be looking into their other films yeom jeong ah is deceitfully cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother finally kap su kim gives an excellent performance as the weary broken father i truly love this film if you have yet to see a tale of two sisters i strongly recommend locating a copy it is a real gem worthy of anyone s collection 
this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story ive had real life experiance with a boy like radio at the football program in my town weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team this movie is really true and i can identify with it a boy like radio just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living thats how radio feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man 
call it manipulative drivel if you will but i fell for it sure there could have been more character development yeah there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant movie of the week score but ed harris was impeccable cuba gooding adorable and touching and let s face it people in real life how many of us really get to know the motivation of others not many we did get a little glimpse into the coach s motivation a very provocative dialog in my opinion not to be soon forgotten so in my opinion this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his comfort zone to reach out to another human being and in the mean time touched the lives hundreds more a lesson we all need to me reminded of why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart you won t be disappointed and bring your kleenex 
radio will have you laughing crying feeling this story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view there s enough for both cuba gooding jr portrays the title character to perfection his performance is worthy of an academy award nomination the compassion of the movie is obvious the movie evokes many emotions i sincerely enjoyed this film 
excellent performances and a solid but not overplayed story helped this movie exceed my expectations this movie was far better than i was expecting after some of the reviews i had read but frankly those reviewers just got it wrong very inspiring and uplifting highly recommended 
i thought this was a really well written film i ve heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can t begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry everyone laugh and most everyone will leave smiling 
 having read the unemployed critic s review i went to a screening of radio not knowing what to expect thankfully the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film director movie critic his review is callous and totally uncalled for this is a movie that will make you laugh it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio truth is he was teaching us he treats us all the time like we wish we treated each other some of the time yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr in an oscar worthy performance is a little over the top at times see the christmas day dance scene but you know what so what every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country we need to be reminded how great we can be this is a solid cast i was particularly pleased to see s epatha merkerson portraying radio s mother do something outside of law and order i always wondered is ms merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal debra winger in a career resurrecting role of coach jones s wife and chris mulkey as protagonist frank clay we cannot over look ed harris s performance as coach harold jones after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self it is hard to truly appreciate mr harris and his contribution to this film as coach jones ed delivers a quiet rock solid performance that of a man on a mission coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do if you see this movie make sure you hang around for the end credits you will be in for a treat as the real james robert radio kennedy now in his mid s is shown still leading the t l hanna football team on to the field every friday night one final note if you were a teen in the mid to late s this movie is worth the price of admission for the sound track alone 
cuba gooding jr is back on top jesus he did a great job in this film i loved this movie its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something anyway i would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat well worth the price of admission and as for cuba gooding jr just give him his next oscar right now 
i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early s i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i m not particularly interested in the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to it s franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiece 
i just got home from seeing radio i ve not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages and and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don t know why we can t have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis 
this is a very moving movie about life itself the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand it should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans and while some of us are gifted with a mind heart and sound body there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky or maybe we re the unlucky ones we don t always see the beauty in the world because we re wrapped up in our blind ambitions and see it only in one light what can this world do for me maybe we all wish we were like radio a loving happy individual who loves everyone 
as one who frequently goes to the movies i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year ed harris and cuba gooding jr gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre 
cuba gooding jr will win the oscar for best actor in and ed harris will win for best supporting actor what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn t get to you then you have ice water in your veins it was the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old we have a white high school football coach and teacher ed harris then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow cuba gooding whose greatest possessions including a radio are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film he gives cuba the nickname radio and what follows is an absoutely riveting engrossing poignant exploration of the human soul the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece 
inspired by true events radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime it definitely is one of the year s best films of radio stars ed harris who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach harold jones coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew one day radio played by cuba gooding jr in his best performance since men of honor comes by the football field while the coach s team is practicing for the game some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong he comes over and helps radio who is frightened and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events he also becomes coach jones s main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes radio had a great mix of comedy and drama some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad in conclusion i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get star reviews and something like school of rock can get or stars it doesn t make any sense to me also the performances as i mentioned before are top notch and oscar worthy in my opinion both ed harris who i think is underrated as an actor and cuba gooding jr should both get some kind on nomination for this movie radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies my final rating for radio is a 
cuba gooding jr and ed harris are touching this movie is really surprising it was enjoyable from start to finish the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team 
this is a movie you ll either love or hate i loved it if you are looking for suspense great special effects action sophistication cynicism etc you won t find it in this movie it is a feel good movie sentimental positive uplifting the heroes of the movie are coach jones played by ed harris a man of strength and integrity and radio cuba gooding jr a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world i guess i didn t find this movie to be sentimental hogwash as so many did because it felt very real to me i know people like these i ve seen jocks who think it s fun to pick on the vulnerable i ve seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable i ve seen people who think high school football is serious business i ve seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew i did laugh i did cry i left the movie feeling good remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world if there aren t people like them in yours you might not like the movie if you don t like a movie that shows the better side of human nature you ll hate it 
radio was a very good movie and honestly i never cry in movies but it had me pretty close to tears it really got to me when radio s mom died and he just wouldn t get out of his room i felt really sad about how if you were mentally retarded you wouldn t really be able to understand death i really liked the movie and it s a must see 
i m normally not a drama feel good movie kind of guy but once i saw the trailer for radio i couldn t resist not only is this a great film but it also has grreat acting cuba gooding jr did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy a k a radio ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well so for a great story great acting and a little comedy i give radio a out of 
radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do the viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done the adversity that coach jones and radio both faced was both tragic and predictable people did not understand nor did they want to understand but in the end the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature intuition compassion and love coach jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how it was sad the way coach jones and radio met the practical joke that terrified the life out of radio was enough to make you want to severely punish not only the boys involved but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it however on the positive side of the scale the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies this movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed ed harris was his usual brilliance gooding was flawless radio is an inspiration 
despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesn t quite reach the level of joe d amato s similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombie s al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less than spectacular finale much like d amato s emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but don t get your hopes up there s no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldn t help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by 
 radio is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy nicknamed radio and the football coach from the t l hanna high school harold jones cuba gooding jr is excellent as radio i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies ed harris is great as harold jones but this actor is great so this is not anything new the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy always walk around the t l hanna high school without bothering anyone and almost not noticed one day when the football s ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of johnny cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met one day cash decides to punish james mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up when coach jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help james who gets the nickname radio because of his passion for radios in general the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story it has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call normal radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that s a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives 
can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a south carolina town the answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap james kennedy understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene also the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience coach jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart radio directed by michael tolllin is a formula film inspired on a true story yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast coach jones is instrumental in getting the young man who is called radio because his passion for collecting them involved in sports a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life coming from a poor background radio lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach s intentions radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot at first then his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body the film owes a lot to ed harris and cuba gooding jr who make a great pair as the coach and radio mr harris one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence he gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past cuba gooding jr is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man the supporting cast is excellent s ephata merkerson one of the best actresses of her generation does interesting work as the mother of radio alfre woodard another good actress plays the high school principle with style debra winger only has a few scenes in the film radio while being sentimental will warm anyone s heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them michael tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us 
ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film it s a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didn t incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio 
this was unusual a modern day film which was ultra nice in fact it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts as i watching this based on a real life story i was thinking nobody is this nice this tolerant mainly i was referring to ed harris role as coach jones i think they went a little overboard on his character but that s better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life odd to see harris playing the role too since he has a long resume of playing nasty profane characters anyway i never complain about a nice feel good film and it is nice to see a bunch of well meaning kind people those folks direct their friendship love and compassion to james kennedy better known as radio a mentally slow high school kid played by cuba gooding jr the story takes place in the mid s in south carolina gooding does a nice job with the role too however like sean penn s role of a mentally challenged man in i am sam an hour and a half of a character like this is plenty after that the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear note it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that in real life in took years for radio to make his transformation not months as shown in the film 
not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart i read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered i felt cuba gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike sean penn s drooling fool portrayal in i am sam the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming sports are taken seriously in small town high school america and elsewhere i suspect and i felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true at least for me the coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under radio s loving and open ways very well done to all out of debra winger we need more of you in pictures 
corniness warning as many fellow imdb users already know i m not a corny cheesy person if you don t want to read this kind of review then go to tell you the truth you re hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene spoilers one day i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts former child star last year in august the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly it was for radio the moment i saw the trailer i just had to see this movie on opening weekend when that weekend rolled along scary movie was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out good boy and radio i couldn t get a ticket and the following weeks i was busy with more important things about months later my friend rented radio he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room i ll tell you this now this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever when radio s mother died it just came out automatically the next day i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie cuba gooding jr stars as a mentally challenged man nick named radio ed harris co stars and this movie is directed by mike tollin based on a true story radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around he s got his own collection at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film one day radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on ed harris plays mr jones the football coach they meet and this is the life of radio throughout the whole movie radio and coach jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys the lowest lows and just seeing radio live his life you will laugh cry and live the life of radio with him this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if you re someone who just wants a great drama radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen radio will never be forgotten by me never as ed harris character said greatly near the end of the movie we re not teaching radio radio is teaching us my rating eliason a 
this is one of the best films i have ever seen how anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination first of all gooding s and harris s performances were simply spectacular especially gooding that is the only way i can describe the acting spectacular you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off then you see gooding and his performance was magical as for the plot since it was based on a true person it goes where the lives of the characters go for all the action buffs it might be a little slow but then it s not an action film i definitely give this movie a it deserves nothing less 
excuse me helloooooooooo cuba gooding jr should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film he was the film while the film may be lacking in some areas cuba was awesome and for me this is the best role that he has ever played the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up what a tragedy getting to see the real radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears you need a heart check if you liked simon birch and the mighty you ll love radio too i wish they made more movies like this radio is the real deal 
the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what you d expect the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael tollin mike rich were trying to do first class movie esbj rn nordby birch denmark 
spoilers to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior to stay alive in real war to think off line analytically critically and not linear otherwise you will come to false conclusions that maj gray was dumb or unstable person truth is something completely different he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt o malley is that he wants her to kill him it was his way out he choose it he was not man who will retire if you ve never been on a first line you can t understand it he intentionally prepare his own suicide first he seduced mary jane than intentionally acted as a dumb than stageed argue shutting incident before witnesses to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial than gave her son a bullets to assure he could load her gun later came that night loaded her gun woke her up put her gun in her hands acted as he was attacking her after shot first time he raised knife and cried one kill so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot he also gave her a message with his last cry after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life this is the the only way for me to die as a man yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only prerogative war and army is not what you thought so far grow up finally and save your life till you can she left military life at the end she did understand him and he did not die in vain the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was col sam doran with help of lt tim macy macy didn t know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do he took photos of mary jane and maj gray by order of col sam doran who gave that order because maj gray asked him to do that after she refused to leave army what col doran asked her to do col doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder he knew she cant be found quilty instead of manslaughter there was some possibility to be found quilty with taken photos col doran also suppress argue shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury i have no doubt about outcome of that trial why col doran did that way because he will do anything maj gray ask him to do why because he saved his life on a battlefield why mary jane choose to go to trial because she was a person who have integrity a principles and that is why maj gray choose her it has to be somebody deserving somebody honourable keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour miroslav
gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure sex movie she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum she and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical asian paradise they have decided to keep an open sexual relationship which is played out on their journey to find a secret society tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony the scenery is gorgeous deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored the imagery is very similar to that of the movie black emanuelle it is rich and colorful recommended 
this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the s not like the recent failsafe which seemed more of a stunt than anything else but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought provoking anne heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by sam shepard and eric stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment i found myself waiting for their affair to begin if only because they look so good together this movie is apparently based on a true story and it s a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change directed by christopher menaul who also did the passion of ayn rand with stolz and the prime suspect series this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing 
certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a marine base it deals with the attempted cover up by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine captain the man and woman had been lovers but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married he continued to stalk her going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time finally he broke into her home attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder the major you see was a decorated hero from vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base the captain too had made some enemies in her motor pool command rejecting some male advances in a very butch style there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama which the very capable cast gets across nicely the director and editor however seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view you re lucky if you know where you re at most of the time bear with them though it s a worthwhile story as the captain s court martial trial unfolds and it seems every man s hand is against her even her attorney at times the verdict well after all this is rather a suspense story so you ll have to see for yourself there is a kind of pacifist message folded into the film but forget about that sure war is hell but sometimes it can t be avoided we ll need those marines then even if they aren t always the best champions of fair play internally as kipling says in his poem tommy atkins it s tommy this and tommy that and tommy wait outside but it s room for mr atkins when the troopship s on the tide 
excellent cast story line performances totally believable i realize the close knit group that exemplifies the marine corps but this movie brought fear to my heart the marines let principles be damned it seems that this film was based on real life incidents it shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment anne heche was utterly convincing sam shepard s portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering and eric stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the corp but also his loyalty to his client while high above on his tightrope he knew what his true course of action had to be but he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition loyalty to the corps above all else i sat riveted to the tv screen all in all i give this one a resounding out of 
the man who knew too much is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn t have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens he s an agent that s looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader then he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that he s a spy and proceeds to fall into stewart s arms dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day in a straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals the direction by alfred hitchcock is top notch the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute the scene in albert hall is a classic the original is so slow paced and drab i don t know how people can compare the two just watch the remake and you ll enjoy it i give the movie a out of 
unfortunately due to a sluggish start i can t say that this is one of hitch s best films it very excellent none the less the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back they both give excellent performances not surprising of course really however i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music the climax at the opera house was fantastic and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene also the use of doris day singing que sera sera was excellent especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film so this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look out of 
this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie bernard herrmann appears as himself near the climax the scenery and locations are great except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake which doesn t make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots i ve heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end i rated this movie out of 
some people say the pace of this film is a little slow but how is this different from any other hitchcock movie they all move very deliberately and as a point have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it this movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful the albert hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema that exists in hitchcock s collection the best probably being almost all of rear window pure cinema for hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue in order to tell the story visually this is of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture not many slip ups by hitchcock here and the acting is superb especially by doris day in a rather surprising serious role 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock s black and white low budget original nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master s stable 
 s the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment to those who prefer the original i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier however even though the american version was heaven forbid a big budget blockbuster i believe it blows the british version out of the water i think this is one of hitchcock s best no small feat considering he made over films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to love james stewart america s favorite everyman for so many years does an excellent job playing the distressed father here he can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison doris day yes doris day despite all the criticisms directed toward her i think she makes the loving wife mother an extremely sympathetic person i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is soft spoken and gentle it doesn t mean she is docile and helpless i don t want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn t there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go and i loved que sera sera i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i ve ever heard and deservedly won its oscar it elevated the film to another level the albert hall sequence i don t think it was too long at all i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcock s direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant and the assassin was truly frightening the ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again the last line in the film is highly amusing i don t think the film started out slowly hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job i wasn t a huge fan of the kid playing hank but i didn t have a problem with him since hank was ben and jo s kid i cared about him too it s not like he was a brat or anything i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues way to go hitch 
i can t believe this movie only scores this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcock s movies such as vertigo or marnie the only reason i can think of why the score is so low is that for the most part the man renounces violence and certainly won t get a diploma in sex and crime what it derives its tension from is not violence it s the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails today having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as mel gibson s ransom this seems normal but in the s where family was all in contemporary america the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot and this tension still works for me today yeah these guys are selfish ignorant bastards disturbing in how they act it s a deal for them and they want to be good businessmen disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera what makes the movie great however are the creative aspects the kinky ideas of hitchcock the outrageously disturbing scene in the church which brings it to the viewer s attention how alone how abandoned the protagonists are nobody caring nobody helping the people in the church just going home the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals which stresses the somewhat oriental flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad last not least the role of music in this movie music is the key principle here as spoiler the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti gong so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second bang and then of course doris day singing que sera which became more famous than the movie itself she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy all in all a classic 
i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it what s great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn t really matter the pace in languid and the settings are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability according to imdb al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous there s one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i ve ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid air and al cliver is filming all of this with his mm camera i kid you not ridiculous we later see that mm footage being edited on a moviola while the footage rolls al and annie start making out this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn t so silly speaking of drag another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex in fact orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he s with annie belle this is another minor complaint about laure there s nudity but it s not as much as other films of the same era it just needed more skin to punch it up except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments laure is actually very watchable i love these kind of softcore films from the s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today p s make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple laura gemser and gabriele tinti the music in that movie is also great 
less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo rear window or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest shot largely on location in morocco and london the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all american couple and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart a midwestern doctor is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out que sera sera written for this film in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock s greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole it s hitchcock light but recommended gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
one of master director alfred hitchcock s finer films this is the story of an american and his family james stewart doris day and their young son who are vacationing in north africa stewart is a doctor and day is a world famous singer they meet a frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus later one the frenchman whispers something into stewart s ear after he is attacked and dying the rest of the film is a puzzle as stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery the movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences you never really know what s going on in this film why people are appearing until the end and even then you re not sure the final scene takes place in albert hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for minutes with no dialog hitchcock had originally made this film in 
this film is the one which you fall in love with alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity gripping drama the another best thing about hitchcock s films is a definite gripping end any thing said about the man who knew too much is less the cinematography acting dialogs camera works are magnificent in this movie the song que sera sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie this film is absolutely brilliant as good as vertigo 
am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the english film the english version has no suspense looks antique and very low budget and has unexceptional acting except for peter lorre the version besides having top production values shows james stewart as the perfect innocent american abroad and gives doris day her best role ever of particular note is the music the music of the american film is almost classic compare the albert hall sequences of both and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version even though it s basically the same music the only flaw in the film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better 
alfred hitchcock s remake of the man who who knew too much is usually not considered to be as good as the original but for me it is one of the best films ever i prefer it over vertigo and rear window like north by northwest it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family while the original was good for it s time it is hard to watch by today s standards the remake has excellent production quality an endearing doris day and a really creepy villain don t bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over 
this isn t among my favorite hitchcock films though i must admit it s still pretty good among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart he always improves even the most mediocre material and the incredibly scary looking assassin who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him although it cost the studio a lot of money i didn t particularly care for doris day in the film she seemed to weep a lot and belts out que sera like a fullback yes i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner but this forever made me hate this song sorry the other complaint though minor i had about the movie was that it was a little too polished and hollywood esque the original version also done by hitchcock just seemed a lot grittier and seedier and this added to the scary ambiance 
if there s one good suspenseful film this is one of them james stewart puts on a dazzling performance as american dr ben mckenna who with his wife and son are in africa on tour they stumble on a murder scene and dr mckenna s son is kidnapped hours later before you can say fasten your seat belts dr mckenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it however other people know he can be dangerous dangerous to them that is and try to dispose of him eventually hank the son is found alive and well if you like suspenseful movies this is the one to watch my score 
james stewart plays dr ben mckenna who with his wife and son are tourists in an arabian city they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene the victim whispers something in dr mckenna s ear and he is told to do something later his son is kidnapped the kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew but the woman is a bit softer than the man the song que sera sera whatever we ll be we ll be is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie doris day play s stewart s wife and she sings the song mentioned above her performance is oscar worthy i m surprised she wasn t even nominated my score 
i have been getting into the hitchcock series very much lately i find myself always renting one of his movies when i m at blockbuster or hollywood video like i said before hollywood is loosing it s touch incredibly i needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there not to mention i want to be a film appreciator not a movie buff is there any better way to do that than with alfred hitchcock s movies the man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring alfred s favorite leading man james stuart and the woman who steals the show dorris day they play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son but when a spy tells james some information that could arrest another spy his son is kidnapped and held for ransom james seems to just doubt dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick the acting again i would say that dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast james did a great job keeping up together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film i loved the little bit of comedy at the end that alfred added you ll see what i mean i would always highly recommend this film despite not being the best hitchcock film it s still a treasure 
i hate to admit it but i didn t find it to be one of hitchcock s best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchock s movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart the man who knows too much and his wife jo mckenna doris day are holidaying in morocco with their son hank christopher oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hank i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock s other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable in comparison to the great director s other works i believe this isn t as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film 
i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early s i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i m not particularly interested in the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to it s franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiece 
ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet they know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at albert hall in london the movie is rich in hitchcockian incidents a friendly but opaque frenchman seems to grill the innocent stewart a doctor from indiana a little too intensely to be merely idly curious later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise a knife in his back and whispers some information about the murder plot to stewart stewart tells his wife doris day looking very saucy indeed but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son s life instead the couple try to track down the assassins buy them off and get their son back taking them from morocco where hitchcock has given us his usual tourist s eye view of the customs locations and food to london there is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set to between stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop the staff are more concerned about guarding their half stuffed specimens than anything else and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish in the course of the scuffle stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger the action boosted along by bernard hermann s bumptious score the scene ends with stewart rushing out the door hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion s head gaping at the slammed door there is also a running gag well done about some visitors waiting around the couple s hotel room in london waiting for things to be explained there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on one is the relationship between stewart and day which is not as rosy as it ought to be considered as a bourgeois ideal she s been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known and she s given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc that s understandable in say a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right it isn t delved into but the edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe dimaggio and his then wife marilyn monroe who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea oh joe she gushed did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer seventy thousand muttered joe former hero of the new york yankees the second problem is one of allegiance who is of greater social value one s own young son or an unknown ambassador do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the albert hall her solution opts for allegiance to political stability although her motives are problematic does she scream to save the ambassador s life or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her cf alec guiness falling on the detonator at the end of the bridge on the river kwai the photography is extremely good and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of london it s mid day and stewart is alone and determined but frightened too there are footsteps echoing on gulliver street from someone somewhere is he being followed is his life in danger and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him the director had a rare disagreement with francois truffaut while being interviewed for truffaut s otherwise laudatory book truffaut argued that the earlier version of the man who knew too much lacked the depth of the later version hitchcock replied it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience but finally agreed that the s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional no argument there this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenith 
 the man who knew too much falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the s not a masterpiece of suspense by any means but an awful lot of fun nonetheless james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist so much of this movie reminded me of the chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play that i have to believe that film was inspired by this neither film is a big deal but both are easy to enjoy grade b 
dr ben mckenna james stewart and jo mckenna doris day travel to morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named louis bernard daniel g lin on a bus the next day this man is murdered but before he dies he tells ben a secret an assassination will take place in london the crooks kidnap the couple s son hank christopher olsen making sure ben won t reveal their plan to anybody alfred hitchcock s the man who knew too much is a very intense thriller the acting is superb as it always is in hitchcok s films james stewart is marvelous doris day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well the song que sera sera has an important part in the movie this movie is a movie of many classic scenes in the final scenes at the albert hall done without dialogue you can barely blink your eyes this movie is fifty years old now time hasn t decreased its power in any way 
hitchcock s remake of his film concerns about the known story of mckenna marriage james stewart doris day in the first version leslie banks edna best along with their years old son travelling through morocco during vacations in a bus they know a sympathetic french person daniel gelin in the old version pierre fresnay while they are in marrakech they also know a couple bernard miles and brenda de banzie and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing the dying whispers a political message then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and mckenna gets help to morocco s inspector buchanan ralph truman this is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they re forced into action is excellently played by james stewart and doris day this exciting film displays suspense intrigue tension and interesting drama well written by john michael hayes and charles bennett packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny intelligent villains colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in morocco and london studios by cameraman robert burks though with excessive transparency for marrakech scenes lavish sets by henry bunstead hitchcock s usual and working until his recent death of course the highlights are the happenings of the famous royal albert hall of london assassination where a sneering killer reggie nalder tries to execute while composer bernard herrmann is conducting orchestra besides at the climax doris day singing que sera que sera meantime her son suffering risks the song won oscar for ray evans jay livingstone the story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining rating better than average hitchcock s enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it 
i put this second version of the man who knew too much to my top hitchcock movies together with frenzy it s probably the most argued film among the fans of hitchcock i consider it far better than say rebecca which has gained unreasonably much appreciation the film contains many ingenious scenes most of them have been mentioned in other reviews but that s something to be expected from hitchcock it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen but that time is used for preparing the following happenings which are full of intriguing suspense if you can ignore the clumsy rear projections the only weakness of this film is the main villain played by bernard miles who is a rather flat and undeveloped character luckily there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie nalder and hank the little boy isn t as irritating as most kids in old movies 
the movie which was directed by alfred hitchcock was brilliantly made it starts with a family of three a doctor james stewart his wife doris day who is a former stage singer and their young son my guess is about years old who are traveling through morroco for leisure on the bus the bump into a french government agent and they are a little too nice to him he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought he wants to carry this information out to someone so he goes to the only person he even slightly knows james stewart the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him his son would be killed stewart has to travel to london because that is where his son is and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be the movie is very suspenseful there are many twists and turns typical hitchcock movie also it has just the right amount of comic relief in addition to all of that it won an oscar for doris day s performance of que sara sara this movie is very good it is hard to find a problem about it i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans i give this movie an a only because it is a little bit predictable 
 the man who knew too much is alfred hitchcock s own remake of his thriller about a married couple james stewart and doris day on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder espionage assassinations and the worst of all kidnapping of their years old son the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun stewart and day have a good chemistry together the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense the inclusion of que sera sera proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like que sera sera did in the man who knew too much hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin storm cloud cantata for almost ten minutes while scene in london s royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous 
a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception it s a remake doris day is in it she sings hitchcock s second crack at the man who knew too much is his most under rated film and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right this is in more ways than one doris day s film not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against james stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his this is after all a film in which music is both motif and plot device what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation consider day s jo mckenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son this seems to be a mutual decision and she doesn t appear to be unhappy but look at the way stewart teases her in the horse drawn carriage over her concerns about louis bernard implying that she is jealous that bernard wasn t asking her any questions about her career this is clearly a recurrent joke between them she responds with a har de har har that denotes the familiarity of this gag suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement and that they both realise it after their son has been kidnapped stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news this is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career the potency of that voice is demonstrated in the ambrose chapel sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent at the albert hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive lungs that saves a man s life and in the embassy finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son by contrast all of stewart s masculine activity is counterproductive his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed thus depriving the police of potentially useful information it is only when his action is joined to his wife s voice in the rescue of hank from the embassy that he actually succeeds in doing something useful far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing que sera sera acts as the first musical device in the film foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the mckennas the future s not ours to see indeed it also neatly prepares the way for the finale in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall this lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually we see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say we don t need to the images say everything it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds the editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly there isn t a frame out of place anything that doesn t relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment the geography in which all this is playing out it builds slowly but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable when jo screams it isn t just a relief for her but for the audience the ambrose chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick in the mud nonconformist church the embassy sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that preceded it on first viewing but second time around actually seems more effective with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background reminiscent of the music as ambient noise in rear window the score as a whole is subtle allowing the music from on screen sources to be foregrounded effectively bernard miles is a low key villain a little banal but with a dry wit he s outshone by brenda de banzie as his wife who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin her stance is pure gangster s moll belying the middle england exterior but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards hank stewart is excellent although if hitchcock really did always cast him as everyman as the director s daughter seems to think then it confirms that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in rope a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive necrophiliac in vertigo day is nothing short of phenomenal just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped she never overdoes anything but neither does she sell it short this is one of hitchcock s most emotionally effective films he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the mckennas they feel the most fully human of all his central characters 
many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much which i have not had the opportunity to view by itself the version is a very well done film the run of mid to late fifties hitchcock films including rear window dial m for murder vertigo and to catch a thief as well as this film is one of my favorite periods in his career in the man who knew too much jimmy stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always doris day is very believable in the role of an atypical hitchcock blond i thought there was nothing fake about her performance her character may not have been written as strongly as the original but she s definitely not reduced to the role of a passive yes dear pretty thing on jimmy stewart s arm there were some really clever lines written for hank the couple s son who later gets kidnapped in the opening scene on the bus it s too bad christopher olsen read them so woodenly it s rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the s though most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent though most notably the assassin played by reggie nalder some little touches that make this film undeniably hitchcockian the use of non english dialog especially french something hitch did on a much larger scale in to catch a thief the use of foreboding arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears stewart and day talking to each other in the church singing their words to the tune of the hymn the albert hall scene specifically showing the musicians and the assassin s accomplice following the score building up tension as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready and finally the assassin s gun as it appears from behind the curtain it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically an effect hitch used at the end of spellbound also all in all the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch it s not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films vertigo strangers on a train but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces 
alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own british film the man who knew too much this take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one mr hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next thus keeping a standard in his work robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini s editing shows his talent ultimately bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr hitchcock in this version he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son when we meet him they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins his wife is the lovely doris day at her best she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother the film has some good supporting cast brenda debanzie bernard miles daniel gelin alan mowbray among others do a great job in portraying their characters although this is a light hitchcock one can t dismiss it as a failure the man who knew too much is a change of pace for hitchcock s fans

many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message thus confusing the hero not to mention the audience dr ben mckenna james stewart and his wife jo a former musical star doris day are vacationing in morocco with their son hank christopher olsen when they meet mr and mrs drayton a british couple brenda de banzie and bernard miles they are also befriended by a charming frenchman louis bernard daniel gelin who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute the mackennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the draytons when they spot louis bernard the next day in the market place they are caught in an assassination intrigue while they are wandering in the local market the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers dr mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms a knife sticking out of his back gulping his last breath the dying man mutters some words and collapses dr mckenna is completely taken aback when the arab s hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise mckenna is left knowing too little but as far as the assassins are concerned too much to prevent dr mckenna from revealing what he knows the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnapping how to get the little boy back safely the subplot about the assassination is just the setup the film is a breathless escapade the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor accidentally involved in political intrigue his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly human a person we could easily identify with it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film by the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth etting s biopic love me or leave me but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents the casting of character actor reggie malder as the assassin is brilliant the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil 
alfred hitchcock s more assured telling of a film he made twenty one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur and although it certainly isn t a bad film he does appear to be right that being said this remake although definitely better still isn t among hitchcock s best work that s certainly not to say that it isn t good it s just more than a little overindulgent and that drags it down hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out and these are parts of the film that aren t entirely relevant to the plot which can become annoying some of these dragged out sequences such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in but for every restaurant scene there s an opera sequence and it s the latter that make the film worse the plot follows a middle aged doctor and his wife that go to morocco for a holiday with their young son while there they meet a french man on the bus and another middle aged couple in a restaurant however things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back shortly after whispering something to the doctor the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple s son is kidnapped which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it and it manages to hold this all the way through in fact i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made like most of hitchcock s films this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused there is also more than a little humour in the movie which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on and actually works quite well the original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre this film doesn t benefit from his presence unfortunately but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart and doris day james stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the greatest actor of all time crown his collaborations with hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him and this one is no different although his best performance remains the one in mr smith goes to washington stewart conveys all the courage conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly in fact that s one of the best things about this film you are really able to feel for the couple s loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling doris day on the other hand is a rather strange casting choice for this movie she s definitely a good actress but she s more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little as i ve mentioned this is not hitchcock s best film but there s much to enjoy about it and although i d recommend many hitchcock films before recommending this one i ll definitely give it two thumbs up as well 
the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen the original film was shot inside a studio for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him paramount decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget this is shot on location in marrakesh and london and has two big international names for box office this was james stewart s third of four hitchcock films and his only teaming with doris day and her only hitchcock film i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock favored possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his blondes doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who befriended them in morocco stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene but doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in morocco and they make the acquaintance of frenchman daniel gelin and the aforementioned english couple bernard miles and brenda dabanzie gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in marrakesh and whispers some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london their child is snatched in order to insure their silence for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother the song was que sera sera and i remember it well at the age of you couldn t go anywhere without hearing it in it even competed with the fast rising elvis presley that year que sera sera won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in days it became doris day s theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax instead of doing it with mirrors hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it s not directed it s choreographed you ll be hanging on your seats during that moment this was remake well worth doing 
anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time lou myers as half step wilson provides many hilarious moments 
many funny scenes about the people that you don t normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do lou myers was very funny as half step wilson any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie 
fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and brian s neighbor alex i giggled alot and even cried a little

there is a lot to like in this film despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes i for one was sure it was the teacher in fact that would have been more probable plot wise because the idea of the best friend s boy friend kind of came out of nowhere i guess the point of that is that rape is omnipresent you never know who it is going to be ms beller is luminous as always yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement like all preachy films the plot lasts minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip blythe danner as the mom is in the role she was born to play the fretting over protective mom some good s scenes for s fans the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark stained beams barrels oak and cork a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of s high school melodrama or s kitsch in general
